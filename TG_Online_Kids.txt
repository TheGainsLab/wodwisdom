CROSSFIT KIDS SCIENCE

INTRODUCTION

Since its inception in 2006, CrossFit Kids has understood the importance of having published research support and
affect the program. Research from such disparate fields of study as behavioral science to molecular biology provides
not only the core framework for what and how aspects of the program are implemented but more importantly, why.

The references and information that follow are included for several reasons. First and foremost, this section provides
many avenues for CrossFit Kids Trainers to further their education. The topics presented here are merely a first step
and not intended to be exhaustive. The journey to become the most qualified trainer possible never ends; you can
always benefit from gaining more experience and knowledge. Secondly, supporting literature is valuable when dis-
cussing the CrossFit Kids program with parents. There is no greater responsibility than being entrusted with anoth-
er's child; having external studies to support your program can instill an additional level of confidence from them as
well as with you, the trainer. Finally, for those who desire to bring CrossFit Kids into specific schools or districts, this
information may be the basis for a presentation to principals or superintendents in support of potential benefits
and efficacy.

A PRESCRIPTION TO IMPROVE HEALTH

As an organism, humans are accustomed to a very different lifestyle (1). In prehistory, the diet of our ancestors was
extremely varied and movement was a necessity (hunter-gatherers walked 5-9 miles per day)(2). As the Agricultural
Revolution spread across the globe (~10,000 years ago), the diet of our species became more restricted. Foods that
were grown became the staples; whereas diversity decreased, quantity and accessibility increased. Homo sapiens of
this time period may have walked less, however they still worked quite hard to tend to their crops (2). Fast forward to
the Industrial Revolution (~250 years ago), when food variety decreased even further as did the variety of activities in
daily jobs (2). Today the variety of our diets is very restricted and we walk less than 0.3 miles per day, quite a change!
Food products today generally contain more refined sugar and less fiber, leading to an increased insulin response
and caloric uptake (2). The resulting “metabolic perturbation” has implications for the obesity epidemic (3).

Obesity is a result of a mismatch between the environmental conditions we evolved in over the course of the vast
majority of our history and the conditions and behaviors of today; resulting in what Lieberman (2) calls dysevolution.
Dysevolution refers to the lifestyle we pass on culturally, to subsequent generations (2). Because these are not genetic
changes they can be affected by compensatory changes in environment and behavior. CrossFit is one component of
how to change the behaviors of adults, in an attempt to reverse our maladaptation to our current circumstances. The
goal of CrossFit Kids is to break the cycle of passing on poor behaviors, by instilling in this and future generations of
children a positive association with exercise, a desire to be fit, and a goal to live a long healthy life.

The need to achieve this goal becomes clear with the realization that within the United States, the prevalence of
individuals 2-19 years old who had body mass index measurements at or above the 95th percentile for their age and
gender was 16.9% in 2012 (4, 20, 21). Obesity engenders additional near-term morbidities such as: hyperinsulinemia,
glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and depression (5,21). In the long term there is an increased risk of
obesity as an adult, heart disease, cancer, and osteoarthritis (5,21). The acute nature of this problem is represented
by the fact that “childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30
years” (21).

Children being overweight and obese is not only a problem within the United States, but also globally. “Worldwide,
in the period 1990-2010, there was a relative increase of 21% (first decade) and 31% (second decade) in the preva-
lence of early childhood overweight and obesity, whereas the forecast for the relative increase in the coming decade
(2010- 2020) is 36%. Fifty-three of the 111 countries with trend data show a rising trend” (6). The actual numbers are
staggering, in 2010 43 million children throughout the world were overweight or obese; more than 80% were from
third-world countries (6).

The rapid increase in the prevalence of this condition, especially within the most recent generations, suggests that
genetic factors are not the primary cause (5,7). Changes in lifestyle appear to be an instrumental factor (8). Sedentary
behavior is a contributing factor to the decline of health indicators in children (9) and adults (10). This association
of behavior and outcome is made even more troubling from the observation that “the percentage of 9th to 12th
graders undergoing daily physical education in US schools has declined from 42% to 27% (1991-1997)” (7). However,
the increase in sedentary behaviors emerge well before high school; “recent epidemiological reports indicate that
contemporary youth are not as active as they used to be, and this decline in physical activity seems to emerge by age
6" (11). This shift in activity patterns has led to the coining of the term Exercise Deficit Disorder (11,12) in order to begin
to establish the parameters to monitor and confirm the best methods of intervention; as well as train the personnel
within society that can effect change (7,11,12,13,14).

CrossFit Kids is composed of elements designed to reduce Exercise Deficit Disorder and poor lifestyle choices: laying
foundational movement patterns, providing children with a portion of their prescribed amount of exercise for the
week, improving muscular fitness, engineering endless opportunities for success, and discussing roles for food—all
while keeping the class and its information fun and engaging (14,15,16). As an infinitely scalable program CrossFit Kids
can also bring the benefits of physical activity to disadvantaged populations (17,18,19).

CLASS STRUCTURE PROMOTES LEARNING AND RETENTION

The CrossFit Kids program, first and foremost, provides individuals between the ages of three and eighteen with a
portion of their prescribed physical activity in a fun and engaging format. The goals of the CrossFit Kids program
however, are more far reaching in the short as well as the long term. For example, one intent is to have the children
learn the points-of-performance of foundational movements that have universal application; developing motor
recruitment pathways, ensuring safe and efficient movement now as well as into the future. Along the way, what they
do and how they feel because of it will provide them a definition of what fitness is and means to them. In addition,
layering information about food into the program leads to an understanding of and a mechanism to adhere to a
healthier lifestyle. CrossFit Kids classes also provide an opportunity to hone life skills. Skills such as perseverance
and working hard as well as those espoused by SHAPE America (formerly American Alliance for Health, Physical
Education, Recreation and Dance—AAHPERD) including: acknowledging personal responsibility, accepting feedback,
working with others, following rules, and exhibiting etiquette (1).

It is appropriate that a significant amount of education occurs within the various CrossFit Kids classes, because

“exercise boosts brain power” (2,3)(see also the Positive Changes In Brain Function section below). Additionally, as a
species, we are designed to learn by actively moving through and experimenting in our environment (2). Within the
CrossFit Kids program, classes and instruction are designed to capture and maintain the attention of participants,
reinforcing learning points; many of our methods are based on those outlined in Brain Rules (2).

Human brains store information as a complex set of connections between neurons. The connections are called
synapses and we are not born with every synapse preformed, awaiting assignment. Instead, our brains physically
change to make synaptic connections and encode information. The discovery that a brain is not a static organ was
first made in a sea slug, the invertebrate Aplysia californica by Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Eric Kandel (2). Indeed, the
plasticity of our brains ranges from an everyday occurrence to specialized responses; such as allowing victims of
strokes to “relearn” how to control limbs. Under normal conditions, the growth and death of neurons as well as the
formation and removal of synapses is a tightly controlled process (4). Importantly, everyone's brain does things a little
different than the next person (2,5) and everyone experiences life in their own unique way. Therefore, it is incumbent
upon us as CrossFit Kids Trainers to utilize as many techniques as possible to affect the most number of children.

Capturing an individual's attention is a critical first step to teaching. (2). Novelty is a straightforward way of focusing
awareness. Things that are new or unexpected tend to engage us (2). CrossFit Kids classes always have an aspect
of unpredictability; they are constantly varied. There is a consistent structure to the class, but what happens within
each of the components of the class is what changes. Classes are built on a foundation of age-appropriate short
segments that allow goals to be accomplished within them, and are not too long to lead to boredom. The whiteboard
is an opportunity to highlight distinctive aspects and build on the excitement of making the unknown, known (2;
p116). Then, with the start of every segment during a class, attention may need to be refocused, especially for the
younger age groups.

Making the subject or activity interesting is another way to create engagement. What is interesting or important
to different age groups varies dramatically, and finding that is a key responsibility for a CrossFit Kids Trainer. For
example, while explaining to junior-varsity athletes that getting stronger will increase their chances to making varsity
next year, that will not motivate preschoolers. For the younger ages, a motivator may be letting them know that the
more they exercise, the longer they can take their pets for a walk. Additionally, the game at the end of class is THE

most important motivator of the class to preschoolers and kids. Just reminding them of the game may garner atten-
tion throughout the class.

The presence of the game also taps into a mechanism of improving retention. “Emotionally arousing events tend to
be better remembered than neutral events” (2; p79). Children know games are fun and pairing a skill within a game
is a powerful way to further associate the skill with being fun. For example, executing a good super-slow air squat
so that you can roll a medicine ball and knock over foam rollers. This emotional connection is not only important for
the short term recall, but more importantly for a long term, positive association between exercise and feeling good.
Another mechanism to foster this connection, especially in teens that do not play games in their classes, is to cele-
brate successes. Positive feedback can be extremely important to an adolescent, we have found that endeavoring to
compliment improvement of any amount fosters a desire to continue the effort.

From the opposite perspective, chronic (and incongruent) stress negatively impacts learning (2,6). Additionally,
chronic stress can reduce efforts to be physically active as well as recovery from activity (7,8). A goal of CrossFit Kids
classes should be to provide opportunities for success and learning to overcome hurdles. For children with stressful
home and/or scholastic environments, these classes may be one of the few positive moments their day. Evidence, in
fact, exists that physical activity is a means to also protect against and remediate the effects of stress (9,10).

John Medina (2; p83) explains that “memory normally works by recording the gist of what we encounter, not by
retaining the literal record of the experience.” Establishing larger themes first, before delving into intricate details
may be a more effective way of teaching. In CrossFit Kids, Preschoolers are taught full movements from the start, for
example a full range-of-motion air squat or shoulder press. Three general positions are cued to delineate the extent
of each movement: where the athlete starts, goes to, and finishes. These refer to the minimum positions that must
be achieved, and are also the limits of our expectations as CrossFit Kids Trainers. Although more detailed points of
performance may be covered in skill work (e.g. knees out or weight on heels) for these young ages, the goal is their
introduction for familiarity not full compliance. Increasingly more detailed instruction is provided to older age groups,
although they all still begin with the simplest global cues; the progression to details however, occurs on an ever more
condensed timeline, from years to perhaps months.

The gradual introduction of more details that reinforce and expand upon the global theme is one way to make the
long-term retention of the information more reliable (2; p147). While this layering refers to the example above with
respect to additional points of performance within a specific movement, it also relates to the overall teaching pro-
gression where complexity increases; for example, starting with the air squat, then the front squat, and finally the
overhead squat. It is worth noting that the final detail added to the long-term instruction of any movement is inten-
sity, either load or speed.

Experiments done by Dr. Richard Mayer support the conclusion that “groups in multisensory environments always
do better than the groups in unisensory environments. They have more accurate recall” (2; p208). To ensure lon-
ger-term retention of the things we teach in CrossFit Kids classes, material is presented to various senses simultane-
ously. For all ages, the desired movement pattern is shown (visual) while the points of performance are established
(verbal), and the class does the movement (tactile). Similarly, teaching information, rather than movement, in classes
also benefits from this paradigm. For example, the association of specific foods with macronutrient classes can be
taught utilizing plastic food replicas and teams shouting answers, all in an exciting game format.

Beyond teaching to various senses, learning is also enhanced if the information is elaborately encoded (2; p110); pro-
viding a context and making the information meaningful not only can capture attention (see above), but also improve
recall (2 p114-115). In preschool and kids, four to six weeks is spent working on a specific skill, allowing the material
to be presented in numerous contexts with the intent of peaking the interest of and engaging as many children as
possible. For example, the beginning of the deadlift for preschoolers may be cued by calling it the “angry gorilla.” That
“start” position can be taught by telling a story about a trip to the zoo, having a contest for the angriest gorilla, explain-
ing how strong gorillas are, or just telling them how fun it is to pretend. Essentially, one enhances the instruction by
briefly, yet creatively elaborating on the age-appropriate “what,” “how,” or “why.”

The methods for teaching outlined above are most effective in conjunction with extensive repetition. “Memory is
not fixed at the moment of learning, but repetition, doled out in specifically timed intervals, is the fixative” (2; p130).
Despite being “constantly varied” CrossFit Kids has the overarching purpose to teach safe and efficient movement;
therefore the context of teaching that movement may vary day to day (see the angry gorilla example above), however
the teaching of the underlying skill (the deadlift) is held constant for four to six weeks. This scheme provides exten-
sive repetition within each class as well as over weekly intervals. Although movement repetition itself is a key ingredi-
ent to motor skill learning, so may be the extensive cognitive processes that occur during the repetitions (11,12,13,14),
leading to enhanced motor solutions.

Imitation and shared attention are relied upon heavily within CrossFit Kids classes to create an effective teaching
and learning environment. “Human children readily learn through social interactions with other people. Three social
skills are foundational to human development and rare in other animals: imitation, shared attention, and empathic
understanding” (15). Indeed, Meltzoff (15) also states “imitation accelerates learning and multiplies learning opportu-
nities. It is faster than individual discovery and safer than trial-and-error learning.” Imitation is most effective when
the transfer occurs from a “skilled to an unskilled agent” (16). The role of the CrossFit Kids Trainer, therefore, is to
provide an environment where imitation can happen in a structured and coordinated fashion. Visual cues are used
constantly to introduce and reinforce movement patterns, from the global to fractional perspective; transferring and
integrating sensory information into a motor pattern, possibly through a mechanism involving mirror neurons (17).
Classes for all age groups are set up to focus attention on a desired example. Preschool classes use a “special leader,”
while kids and teens classes utilize capable demonstrators from within their own ranks. Being the exemplar, chosen
by the CrossFit Kids Trainer is a desired role, a reward for effort and a celebration of success. These individuals, there-
fore, become the ones who others in class imitate. Simplistically, they imitate these demonstrators because they are
told to however it is also via a skill that emerges in infancy, learning through shared attention (18). Shared attention is
the ability to follow the gaze of others to identify targets of interest in the environment; it also necessarily includes an
interpretation of the intentions behind the gaze being followed (15,18). The in-class demonstrators become the focus
of attention for everyone, because of the positive relationship with being chosen by the instructor. This scenario
establishes a definitive subject to be used for learning through imitation and is an opportunity to highlight achieve-
ments or abilities in a constructive manner.

Virtues Of Teaching Movement Skills And Patterns

A goal of CrossFit Kids is to lay the foundation for a healthy lifestyle. As they leave this program, the hope is that
physical activity remains an integral part of their lives, whether as part of continual journey toward general fitness or
in search of optimal performance on the field of sport. A primary mechanism for that is to constantly teach safe and
efficient movement.

In addition, CrossFit Kids supports the philosophical notion of “physical literacy,” looking at the concept broadly:

“It could be suggested that the overarching characteristics of a physically literate individual are that the

person moves with poise, economy and confidence in a wide variety of physically challenging situations.
Furthermore the individual is perceptive in ‘reading’ all aspects of the physical environment, antici-
pating movement needs or possibilities and responding appropriately to these, with intelligence and
imagination. (1).

Physical literacy is also “an end state that needs constant attention to be maintained” (1). Maintenance can be
achieved by improving such capacities as: “balance, coordination, flexibility, agility, control, precision, strength, power,
endurance and the ability to move at different speeds—that is explosively, right through to sustaining a movement
over a long period of time” (1). These are familiar concepts to CrossFit athletes!

Several practical approaches have been developed with the goal to provide physical literacy in a developmentally
appropriate manner (2). The long-term athlete development (LTAD) model most recently put forth by Ballyi (3), dis-
cusses distinct stages of development. He posits windows of opportunity that should be utilized to prevent limiting
future potential. The LTAD model is embraced by the Canadian Sport For Life organization, Lloyd (4) published an
explanation of their Youth Physical Development Model (YPD) that takes the view that “most fitness components
are trainable throughout childhood” (4). More detailed articles concerning components of training within the YPD
model, such as agility and speed, have also been published (5,6). The Integrative Neuromuscular Training (INT) model
is designed to “enhance health and skill-related components of physical fitness” (7). Finally, the curriculum put forth
by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE), an association of SHAPE America, provides a
comprehensive sequence along five stages, for the development of physical literacy in children from kindergarten
to grade 12 (8). Within each stage are specific standards and outcomes to focus on and strive for within a physica
education class. The NAPSE standards are the basis for the K-12 physical education curriculums in numerous states
within the U.S.

The methods used to teach movement within this program are broad, general, and inclusive. They are consisten
with yet do not necessarily adhere to every aspect of the systems mentioned above. In what should sound familiar
to CrossFit athletes, CrossFit Kids espouses a program of constantly varied, functional movements, executed at a
relative (and age-appropriate) high intensity; and is governed by the progression of establishing sound mechanics

and demonstrating consistency before intensity (load or speed) is introduced or increased (9). Powerfully, CrossFi
Kids can leverage the over 11,000 CrossFit Affiliates to insert this paradigm in communities around the world. Addi-
tionally, as of the first quarter of 2015, there are over 2100 CrossFit Kids Affiliates (in 49 countries) and more than 600
schools are using CrossFit Kids.

The idea of consistency would appear to be at odds with realization that the acquisition of motor skills is a dynamic

process. However, the quote below, reprinted from Lee (10) succinctly observes that, in fact, motor skills do not max-
imally benefit from rote repetition and recapitulation of a single motor pattern:

“The process of practice towards the achievement of new motor habits essentially consists in the
gradual success of a search for optimal motor solutions to the appropriate problems. Because of this,
practice, when properly undertaken, does not consist in repeating the means of solution of a motor
problem time after time, but in the process of solving this problem again and again by techniques which
we changed and perfected from repetition to repetition. It is already apparent here that, in many cases,
‘practice is a particular type of repetition without repetition’ and that motor training, if this position is

ignored, is merely mechanical repetition by rote, a method which has been discredited in pedagogy for
some time.” (11)

The dynamic nature of motor solution learning is especially relevant with a population that changes as much as
children do throughout their tenure in the CrossFit Kids program. The first three figures from Verkhoshansky’s
paper entitled “Supermethods of Special Physical Preparation for High Class Athlete” (12) together provide a graph-
ical underpinning to the programming within the CrossFit Kids program. Despite being written expressly for elite
athletes, with a slight change in perspective the figures are equally adaptable for use here.

Figure 1 shows that athletic performance (X-axis) is related to the maximum theoretical motor potential (N) and how
much of it has been realized by the individual (T). Athletic performance needn't be the pinnacle for CrossFit Kids, it
would be equally valid to substitute the broader term fitness. In either case the goal is to have your personal motor
skill set reach your inherent potential to accomplish desired tasks, although it often just asymptotically approaches
it. A motor function (F), or fitness in the CrossFit Kids context, is improved over time (T), as shown in Figure 2. This
figure however, suggests that increases in intensity (J) need only happen in later stages of training, once a motor
function approaches peak levels. Similarly, intensity should not be introduced to children until a solid foundation of
fitness, movement mechanics, and consistency is developed. Figure 3 introduces the idea that athletic performance
(X-axis) is correlated with improving the leading motor function (f) for that endeavor; and that advancement of other

functional systems (A, B, and C) support the former. Indeed, for CrossFit Kids, fitness (or physical literacy) is contin-
ually developed and reinforced through complex interactions between underlying components, such as learned
motor skill sets, desired tasks, and available environments (or capacities, environmental situations, intentions, and
perceptions [1]). Practice and accomplishment in one necessarily leads to advances in others.

The importance of a general physical preparedness (GPP) program like CrossFit Kids is underscored by the fact that,
“regular participation in organized sports activities does not ensure that youth are adequately exposed to fitness
components that can improve their health and reduce risk of injury” (13). Additionally, focusing on a single sport
can lead to overuse injuries (14), whereas sampling multiple sports may be beneficial for strength and motor coor-
dination (15). Indeed, resistance training and GPP may prevent sports related injuries (16,17). Especially for physical
education teachers, NASPE published a position statement on guidelines for youth specialization or multiple-sport
participation (33), stating that specialization has more risks than rewards.

Within CrossFit, it is well understood that optimal sports performance is the culmination of successful training for a
substantial amount of time. As described above for Verkhoshansky’s Figure 3 (12), there are other functional systems
that support the leading motor function for a sport. CrossFit has established three broad movement-related tiers
that provide a foundation for sports performance: metabolic conditioning, gymnastics, and weightlifting (9). Again,
for CrossFit Kids, sports my not be the ultimate goal; fitness may be a more applicable state. CrossFit Kids follows this
hierarchy in its programming design as well. The initial goal is to provide a foundation of cardiorespiratory fitness
through relative (and age-appropriate) high-intensity activity. Strength is gained neuromuscularly through body-
weight gymnastic movements until mechanics, consistency, and enough testosterone are present to warrant the use
of an external object in weightlifting.

In addition to these programming attributes, CrossFit Kids recommends the addition of two other types of activity,
impact loading and vestibular work. Each has clear connections to improving athletic skills as well as directly
improving health.

IMPACT LOADING—Bone mineral content deposition reaches a maximal point at approximately 12-14 years old,
between Tanner stages 3 and 4 (18). A larger opportunity exists for females, in that:

“In boys, increased bone growth and accrual is matched by increases in muscle strength. In girls, growth

is slower, but bone growth and accrual is disproportionately greater when expressed in relation to
muscle mass. The implication of this is that the effect of circulating reproductive hormones is to increase
the sensitivity of female skeletons to load compared with males. At the menopause, the reduction in
circulating reproductive hormones has the opposite effect” (19)

Indeed, a meta-analysis “supports previous research highlighting the advantage of performing high-impact,
weight-bearing activity on bone mineral accrual during prepubescence and imply that even non-competitive levels
of weight-bearing exercise can exert a positive influence on the bone health of young girls” (20). The process through
which physical activity can cause greater bone accrual is described by Wolff's Law (21). Bones react and remodel
according to the forces put on them, in this case strengthening them. Bones can sense the forces exerted on them
by mechanotransduction (21,22). Fluid pressure within the bone is monitored by specialized cells and signals down-
stream changes in bone density. This model predicts “high frequency (>30 Hz), low magnitude loads (<1 MPa) loads

are sufficient to elicit cellular response (21). Indeed, this is what has been observed on the gross anatomical scale.
Static loading of the skeleton was ineffective at inducing an increase in bone mass compared to cyclical loading (23).
Although the load is a factor the rate of force or strain change is more critical.

Such forces can be applied to the skeleton of individuals within CrossFit Kids classes without the need for external
load. High frequency impact activities such as jumping and bounding, broadly termed impact loading, are an effec
tive means to cause rapid force changes and perhaps elicit positive changes (24). Without an external load, these
activities are self-scaled by ability to reduce the risk of injury. Regarding load, the rather slow lifting phase as well as
the static hold may do far less to influence bone mass than the sudden de-loading (high frequency change) when the
weight is dropped (or the rapid loading in a jerk)(23). Weeks (25,26) noted sex-specific improvements in bone density
after an eight-month intervention of adding ten minutes of jumping twice a week to an adolescent physical educa-
tion class. Impact loading activities are a priority for all age groups within CrossFit Kids, for the benefits they may
provide to a growing skeleton as well as the improvements they bring about in such physical skills as power, speed,
and streng

>

VESTIBULAR WORK—The overall importance of the vestibular system is underlined by the fact that it evolved
approximately 500 million years ago (27). In humans it is comprised of the semicircular canal system of the inner ear
with nerve efferents extending to various parts of the brain, including the limbic system, the hippocampus, and the
neocortex (27). The vestibular system provides self-motion information by assessing acceleration (27). Vestibular
lesions and dysfunction can cause movement, learning, and anxiety disorders (28,29,30). When Franco (31) con-
ducted vestibular examinations on children performing and underperforming, she found “73.3% of the children per-
forming well at school had normal findings, whereas 32.6% of the underperforming children had normal test results.”

Such interventions in humans as Sensory Integration Therapy (32), cold water irrigation of the outer ear canal, electri-
cal stimulation, as well as rotational treatments in animals have suggested that vestibular stimulation could increase
brain function (27). Partly for this potential benefit, the programming for all age groups within CrossFit Kids classes
contain movements that stimulate the vestibular system; such as log rolls, forward rolls, standing spins, handstands,
cartwheels, and skin the cats. Additionally, training the vestibular system can also improve coordination, balance,
agility, and accuracy. General care and consideration should be taken in implementing these movements; making
sure children are not becoming overly dizzy, nauseous, or scared.

Resistance Training, Benefits And Compliance With External Standards

The benefits a safe resistance training program can have on children and adolescents include: muscle strength,
muscle power, muscular endurance, bone strength, flexibility, agility, physical performance, body composition, car-
diovascular health, injury resistance, psychosocial well being, and promotion of positive exercise habits (1,2,3,4,5,6).

In the general population however, there appears to be an undercurrent of concern that children lifting loads is inher-
ently dangerous. This notion most likely began in 1842 in England and has been discredited by modern sports science
(7). Indeed numerous position statements, backed by research papers, endorse the use of resistance training with
children and adolescents, including: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Strength and Conditioning
Association, the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, the Australian Strength and Conditioning Association, the
UK Strength and Conditioning Association, and an international consensus of endorsing groups (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9).

These publications suggest specific guidelines as well as underlying program designs that should be implemented.
Recommendations from six of the articles spanning the past twelve years are collated in Table 1. The majority of
these published references agree across the board on the guidelines for running a safe and effective resistance-train-
ing program for children and adolescents. By virtue of what is discussed at the CrossFit Kids Certificate Course, con-
tained in this training guide, or available in the CrossFit Journal, the CrossFit Kids program is in compliance with nearly
every recommended feature for an age-appropriate resistance training program (see Table 1).

The CrossFit Kids program takes these guidelines seriously, they focus CrossFit Kids Trainers on reinforcing sound
mechanics, educating proper behaviors, providing opportunities for success and long-term adherence; and most
critically, they lay out a structure for creating a safe environment.

Safety during any physical activity is of the utmost importance considering the adolescent skeleton is actively
growing. Therefore, it is considered immature compared to the adult skeleton (10). The relatively thin layer of cells
that comprise the growth plate (physeal plate), where bones actively grow, is susceptible to injury, in fact:

“Physeal injuries have been reported to account for between 15% and 30% of all skeletal injuries in
children, occurring most commonly after the age of 10. 80% of physeal injuries will occur between the
ages of 10 and 16 years, with a median age of 13 years” (10).

Growth plate injuries can occur from acute trauma as well as repetitive stress, with varying degrees of severity (Salt-
er-Harris Types I-V)(10,11) Types | and II are more likely to have positive outcomes however, Types Ill-V put the future
proliferation of that bone at risk without medical intervention (10). Faigenbaum (12) specifically addresses concerns
for growth plate injuries with respect to resistance training:

“Of note, injury to the growth cartilage has not been reported in any prospective youth resistance
training study that provided professional guidance and instruction. Furthermore, there is no evidence
that resistance training will negatively impact growth in height during childhood and adolescence. The
risk of growth plate injury may be greater when young athletes perform jumping and landing activities
during competitive sport play that induces ground reaction forces of up to five to seven times body mass.”

Additionally, Myer (13) states, “injuries during resistance training are less frequent than in actual sport performance.”
Caine (14) and Emery (15) review the risk factors and incidences in sports-related injuries involving children and
adolescents. From estimates in 1998, the number of weightlifting injury cases in the United States requiring a doctor
were 12.5% of those reported for soccer and 5% of those reported for basketball (14). Furthermore, when specifically
investigated, injuries reported to derive from resistance training vary dramatically in etiology from adult to child
populations (13). More than 75% of injuries sustained by children during resistance training are deemed “accidental,”
and refer to pinching or bruising from actions such as dropping weights on extremities or tripping (13). Meanwhile,
this ratio is reversed for adults; nearly 75% of resistance-training injuries are related to effort and degradation of
technique, resulting in muscle sprains or strains (13).

The CrossFit Kids program strives to prevent injuries due to accidents by actively honing skills such as accepting
personal responsibility, working safely with others, following rules, and exhibiting etiquette. Injuries related to effort
are mitigated by strict adherence to a policy established at the inception of the CrossFit Kids program, “quality of
movement supersedes load and intensity;” a sentiment echoed recently by Faigenbaum (16). While children and
adolescents within the CrossFit Kids program may lift, move, and play with various objects during the course of a
class, when they perform the movements from the foundational series (squats, presses, and deadlifts) the mechan-
ics of and consistency with the movement informs the load. Expectations for what defines acceptable mechanics
change with age; it always includes safe movement and progressively demands adherence to a hierarchy of points
of performance. Consistency not only refers to proper form from one repetition to the next but more importantly
maintenance across longer time domains. Therefore it may be weeks to months for teens, and possibly months

| CrossFit CrossFit Kids Training Guide | 22 of 153

METHODOLOGY CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

CrossFit Kids Science, continued

to even years for younger participants before loads are increased. For example Preschoolers (three to five years
old), although the quality, at times, may be acceptable the consistency never reaches a point to warrant any type
of load or implement being used. With children (generally between the ages of five to twelve years old), mechanics
and consistency may allow the application of a very light load. For the oldest, most adept in this age range the load
may approach ten-pound dumbbells for front squats, various pressing movements, and cleans; while upwards of
a twenty-pound kettlebell may be used for deadlifts. These same standards are used to govern loading teenagers.
As mechanics and consistency improve, loads increase along that same trajectory without the upper limits of the
younger age group; the mandate is that the load is well within the margins of safe and efficient movement for the
time duration and other contributing factors (16). Examples of additional factors include if the movement is being
done during focused skill work, during an intense workout, or in a partially fatigued state. Furthermore, load and
expectation adjustments are made daily based on developmental status (17), growth spurts, injuries, psychological
state, level of recovery, and many other factors that can affect performance. It is recommended that teens do not
attempt one-repetition maximum lifts in the context of this program unless they are mature enough and participat-
ing in related weightlifting or powerlifting competitions. Despite the procedure put forth by Faigenbaum (16) for such
testing, the need is not necessarily apparent; strength can still be tracked by improvements in the maximum lifts
completed in the Teen Weightlifting class.

Positive Changes In Brain Function

With tightened budgets and a need to show scholastic achievement results for their efforts, schools have been
increasingly removing physical education and recess from their curricula (1). Research however, indicates that the
removal of physical activities may cause a significant detriment to academic achievement. In fact, numerous studies
link an increase in physical activity with improved test scores (2,3,4,5). The CrossFit Kids program supports the main-
tenance (and even reintroduction) of physical education and recess in schools. The fact that so many schools and
even districts have embraced the methods outlined in the CrossFit Kids Course and this document is a hopeful sign
that priorities are shifting.

While CrossFit embraces the “black box” concept of not needing to know the specific mechanism through which
changes or adaptations occur, it fully supports scientific investigations designed to further our knowledge concerning
the intricacies of human performance. Indeed, many studies have been conducted assessing the impact of physical
activity on cognitive function. Reviews and meta-analyses generally find a small, yet significant association between
the two parameters (6,7,8). One of the largest, single studies to show a relationship between brain function and
fitness had more than 1.2 million subjects. In an observational, cross-sectional study incoming eighteen year olds
to the Swedish military from 1950 to 1976 were assessed for physical as well as intellectual performance (9). Aerobic
fitness was assessed using a stationary cycle and isometric muscle strength was measured by knee extension, elbow
flexion, and hand grip (9). “Four cognitive tests were used covering the following areas: logical performance test,
verbal test of synonyms and opposites, test of visuospatial/geometric perception, and technical/mechanical skills
including mathematical/physics problems” (9). The results indicated that aerobic fitness, but not muscle strength,
is positively associated with scores on the various intellectual tests (9). In addition, those individuals who improved
their fitness the most from the previous three years showed higher intelligence test scores than those whose fitness
decreased from the age of fifteen (9).

This resulting correlation is from one study in an older adolescent age range and tests for brain function in strictly
defined knowledge categories. Sibley (7) conducted a broader analysis of 44 studies concerning the ages 4 to 18
years old. This meta-analysis also showed a positive relationship between physical activity and cognitive function.
Tomporowski (3) reviews a much smaller set of studies (16 in total) and separates them into three categories of
how brain function was measured: intelligence, cognition, or academic achievement. Tests for intelligence include |Q
tests as well as methods of assessing abilities that “require memory, spatial organization, vocabulary, and problem
solving” (3). Those that quantify cognitive abilities “evaluate mental function at more molecular level of analysis than
do traditional IQ tests” for example, “attention, information processing, working memory, and executive function”
(3). Finally, the most subjective method, academic achievement relies on “standardized tests, academic grades, and
teacher evaluations” (3).

Results from the three studies looking into intelligence, all from the 1960s, were varied and inconclusive (3). In terms
of academic achievement Tomporowski (3) concludes, “at best, the studies reviewed demonstrate that time spent in
physical education classes does not have a deleterious impact on children’s academic progress,” but does improve
their health. Indeed, this sentiment was also noted in a specific study involving third- and fifth-graders (10). Perhaps
the strongest associations exist between physical activity and cognitive abilities. Tomporowski (3) concludes:

“The results of cross-sectional studies indicate that children who are physically fit perform cognitive
tasks more rapidly and display patterns of neurophysiological activity indicative of greater mobilization

of brain resources than do less fit children. Several large-scale experiments provide evidence to
suggest that exercise training exerts specific, rather than global, effects on children’s cognitive function.
Following aerobic exercise training, children’s performance improves exclusively on tests that involve
executive function.”

Similar conclusions were reached from a study involving more than 4500 adolescents from the United Kingdom
(11). In this study, the physical activity was objectively measured by collecting personal accelerometry data over
the course of seven days and further used as a proxy for average daily physical activity. “Higher levels of free-living
moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity had a beneficial association with attention/executive attention task
performance in adolescents, in particular for males” (11). A smaller study showed a more acute effect of exercise;
rather than using average daily activity, a twenty-minute dose of treadmill walking was applied (12). The nine to ten
year olds in this study either walked at 60% of their maximum heart rate or sat quietly. Twenty to thirty minutes
after each of these conditions, the children participated in cognitive tests while their brainwaves were monitored
(12). Compared to the rested control group, those individuals that had exercised had improved response accuracy
in the cognitive tests and greater measured amplitude of a specific brainwave component called the P3 wave; “the
amplitude of the P3 is believed to index the allocation of attentional resources during stimulus engagement, with
greater amplitude indicative of greater resource allocation” (12). Beyond the observation that children with higher
physical activity levels have improved executive function (11,13), this treadmill study suggests a more immediate and
possibly causal association (12). Finally, in a study published in 2011, twenty children aged eight to ten participated
in a nine-month intervention to improve their fitness (measured by VO2 max)(14). As their fitness improved, so did
their performances on some of the cognitive tasks and certain brainwaves (14). Interestingly, a recently discovered
anatomical difference seen in higher fit nine- and ten-year olds is that the white matter in their corpus callosum (as
well as several other brain regions) had an increased integrity compared to lower fit controls (15). This structural
difference raises the possibility that the fit children “have faster neural conduction between brain regions,” leading
to improved cognitive function (15).

Although direct mechanisms have not been proven for these effects, data indicates that it has less to do with genetics
compared to the environment (or what you do). Of the more than 1.2 million subjects discussed in the research study
above, there were 1432 monozygotic twin pairs (9) with identical DNA. Analysis of their fitness and intelligence data
indicated that genetic factors only explained ~15% of the association, while a differential environment explained
the rest (9). Numerous research efforts have begun to show the multifactorial nature concerning the connection
between physical activity and cognitive abilities.

One of the most remarkable post-exercise effects on the brain is the increased growth of new neurons (neurogen-
esis) in the dentate gyrus, a subregion of the hippocampus involved in memory and learning (16,17,18,19,20). The
generation of new neurons is neuroplasticity that has gone beyond merely the remodeling of existing synapses. In
fact, lines of evidence now indicate that a subset of these newly formed neurons are genetically distinct from each
other as well other neurons in the brain (21,22); and may “help to diversify the range of behavioral phenotypes that
are possible from a given genome” (22).

While increased neurogenesis occurs subsequent to exercise, what mechanisms allow the working cardiovascular
system and musculature to signal the brain? Certainly the nervous system itself is a direct link between these systems

that could be utilized. In addition, there are soluble factors that appear to mediate the association of exercise and
brain function. Lactate, a byproduct of glycolysis, could be one such messenger because it is a utilized fuel source
by the brain (23,24). Specific peptides and proteins can also fill this role (26). Myokine, is a recently coined term to
describe molecular messengers that are produced in and secreted from muscle cells resulting in local or distal effects
(26,27). Examples of myokines are: interleukin—(IL) 4, IL-6 IL-7, IL-8, IL-15, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
fibroblast growth factor 21, leukemia inhibitory factor, myostatin, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), calprotec-
tin, erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), and perhaps irisin (26,27).
These myokines are a means of communication from the muscle to diverse cell types and organs, including: adipose

tissue, the liver, the pancreas, bones, the circulatory system, and the brain (27).

IGF-1 is an extensively studied protein, most notably associated with its effects on growth and metabolism (28). In
humans, levels of IGF-1 are positively associated with fitness in untrained children (29); and from animal studies, IGF-1
appears to mediate effects of aerobic exercise (wheel running) on the brain (30,31,32). Indeed, even injecting IGF-1
into the periphery of rats can induce the growth of new neurons in the dentate gyrus region of the brain (33). The
effects of resistance training on circulating levels of IGF-1 in humans remain unclear (34,35). Perhaps the total work
or overall muscle groups utilized has some confounding effect (35).

BDNF also has pleiotropic effects throughout the body, it has been implicated in being involved with such varied bio-
logical processes as circadian rhythms, mood, and heart rate (36). Circulating BDNF levels are increased in individuals
following a regular exercise program and after an acute bout of exercise; although resistance training lacked consis-
tent results (37). Acute and chronic exercise have also been associated with improvements in cognitive function, with
BDNF “tentatively suggested” as a mediator in humans (38); based on more direct connections established in animal
studies (39). In humans, BDNF is released in response to exercise. The signals coordinating this release are actively
being investigated; including signaling cascades involving IGF-1 (30,40) and possibly irisin (41,42). Circulating BDNF
levels increase during activity and decrease toward baseline levels during rest with varying kinetics (38,43,44,45).
The amount of BDNF released is positively correlated with the intensity of the exercise bout (43,46). Interestingly, the
infusion of lactate into the bloodstream of resting humans also induced a transient BDNF peak (47) that appeared
to be independent of changes in blood pH (48). Animal studies indicate that increased stress and forced exercise
reduce the amount of BDNF released and hippocampal neurogenesis (49,50). This result perhaps allows an alternate
hypothesis to why cycling next to a busy roadway resulted in a lower BDNF response than controls (51), and further
supports the need to make each CrossFit Kids class as age-appropriately fun as possible.

The interaction of stress and exercise is not unidirectional (52). Indeed, exercise and the resulting release of BDNF as
well as other trophic factors can have neuroprotective and antidepressant activity as well as improve overall stress
resilience (53,54,55). The benefits that exercise can have on neurobiology as a whole may reach as far as improving
symptoms of ADHD (56,57). Therefore, the inclusion of exercise in childrens’ lives with such programs as CrossFit Kids
is critical to and has dramatic implications for not only their physical health, but their mental and cognitive health
as well. Following this prescription, it is recommended that as programs progress, CrossFit Teen classes end with
approximately seven minutes of cool down and study to take advantage of a unique opportunity to improve their
intellectual performance through any (or all) of the mechanisms described above.

In addition, attempts should be made at every opportunity to prevent the removal of physical education from
schools for these same reasons. There are numerous examples of schools that have seen significant improvements

in test scores and behavior with the incorporation of more physical activity. For example, Learning Readiness PE in
Naperville, IL (59) or City Park Collegiate, a high school in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (60). These examples may have
influenced the founders of the Girls Athletic Leadership Schools in the development of their entire curriculum. As
suggested for high-intensity training programs (58), the CrossFit Kids program is also a powerful mechanism with

which to reinstate movement into the scholastic environment, in terms of its ease of implementation, fitness gains,
and enjoyment.

Rhabdomyolysis and Hyponatremia
Rhabdomyolysis is defined as:

“A potentially life-threatening syndrome characterised by the breakdown of skeletal muscle resulting in
the subsequent release of intracellular contents into the circulatory system.” (1)

Rhabdomyolysis in the adult population has been covered extensively in various CrossFit Journal articles (2,3,4,5).
Rhabdomyolysis can also occur in the pediatric population from a variety of causes (6,7), including being exercise-in-
duced (8). Several reviews have been written on the topic (1,9,10). The risk of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis
occurring in any of the CrossFit Kids populations is mitigated by direct actions taken by CrossFit Kids Trainers. The
preschool and kids age groups are never pushed to continue moving or exercising. If they choose to stop moving
(due to fatigue, discomfort, or because something else caught their attention), it is completely acceptable and is most
likely an indication to stop the entire class and move on to the next segment. For teens, loaded eccentric movements
are significantly reduced or eliminated from programming. Exercises such as jumping pull-ups, downhill running,
heavy kettlebell swings, and GHD sit-ups are examples of movements whose benefits of inclusion or need for volume
might be outweighed by the risks. Certain illnesses, medications, and fitness level are also factors that should be
taken into account by CrossFit Kids Trainers in assessing athlete-specific programming with the intent of reducing
risk of harm (10).

Hyponatremia is defined as:

“A condition that occurs when the level of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an elec-
trolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that’s in and around your cells. In hyponatremia, one
or more factors—ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water during
endurance sports—causes the sodium in your body to become diluted. When this happens, your
body’s water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems,
from mild to life-threatening.” (13)

Of greatest concern, with respect to swelling, is the brain. For a comprehensive review of hyponatremia, its etiology,
history, and prevalence see “Waterlogged” by Noakes (11). CrossFit Kids is not an endurance sport. Within the classes,
none of the age groups participate in activities approaching the time-frame usually associated with hyponatremia.
To reduce the risk of this condition and promote better behaviors, CrossFit Kids does not prescribe a total amount of
water to drink every day or even suggest a drinking schedule. Based on the work of Noakes (11) and Hew-Butler (12),
CrossFit Kids recommends that individuals drink when thirsty and choose water over carbohydrate-laden beverages
and dilute electrolyte-containing “sports drinks.”

OPTIMIZING THE CHILD'S LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

As many teachers and coaches well know, children cannot be thought of simply as miniature adults, they are operat-
ing with a different set of skills and priorities than we are. In order to fulfill our overall objective of instilling a lifelong
love of fitness in kids, we have to tailor our approach to meet them at their level, not only physically, but also cogni-
tively and emotionally. The degree of variance in these parameters both within and across age groups makes training
kids an ultimate expression of the infinite scalability of CrossFit. While there is no perfect solution or fail-safe recipe
for success, there are some governing principles that will guide you towards keeping your CrossFit Kids Program safe,
fun, and effective.

In this article, we look at neurological development in terms of the order and timing of acquisition of physical, cog-
nitive, and social milestones. Also discussed will be various learning strategies as well as how to tailor instruction to
maximize learning for all students. Next, we will look at how our brain strategizes movement and how our sensory
environment influences learning. Finally, some recommendations for how to configure your physical environment,
optimize communication, and create a culture of success in your CrossFit Kids Program for athletes of varied ages
and abilities.

HOW YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN: MAKING THE MOST OF RELATIVE NEUROPLASTICITY

The ability of the human brain to create and change neural pathways (series of connected nerve cells linking multiple
areas of the brain to each other, or the brain to other systems in the body) is referred to as Neuroplasticity. As we
grow from infancy to adulthood we develop and refine the neural pathways needed to perform the myriad of cog-
nitive and physical tasks life requires of us. The early process of /earning has occurred throughout human history in
an overwhelmingly consistent manner, allowing us to develop an estimation of the order and relative timing in which
developmental milestones will occur. Understanding the timing and progression of these milestones is extremely
helpful in determining the appropriate teaching style for a given age group, however it is important to remember that
every child brings their unique combination of genetics and cultural environment (nature and nurture) into every
interaction and so we cannot assume each child comes to us with the exact same set of tools.

In general, the human brain develops the ability to carry out primary functions like movement and sensation first,
followed by things like basic language skills, and finally higher level association areas like attention and behavior
modulation (). It is not by any means a linear progression, however, which is why there are clear changes in both the
cognitive and motor (movement) skills kids demonstrate as they grow.

The average preschooler is still mastering basic balance and coordination skills like running, jumping, and standing
on one foot. Programming for the CrossFit Preschool class is therefore going to remain primarily focused on these
basic gross motor skills, static positions for body awareness (plank holds versus push ups and grip strength in lieu
of pull ups), and the first tier of the foundational movements (air squat, deadlift, and shoulder press). Preschoolers
may not have good awareness of the difference between fact and opinion and will likely have limited understanding
of the perspectives of the people around them; they are learning social skills like cooperating and taking turns but do
so more by rote than by a genuine appreciation of each other's feelings. This age group has a strong desire to please

adults and are often disappointed when they disappoint you, therefore they need constant gentle reinforcement of
behavioral expectations and equally constant affirmation that they are “doing a good job”. The CrossFit Preschool
program is designed to create understanding and comfort with the structure of group exercise, in the context of
playing games and having fun, so that they are prepared for the increased physical and cognitive demands of the
more advanced class formats.

In the School Age years (ages 5-12), physical skills progress with exposure to increasingly complex motor activity. In
our CrossFit Kids classes, we can start to introduce the second tier of foundational movements (Front squat, Thruster,
Push press, and Sumo Deadlift High Pull), vary complexity and directionality of movements in increasingly varied
contexts, and allow them to work to a moderate state of fatigue without catastrophically reducing the “fun” factor.
While they are still relatively focused on the world as it relates to them, children in this age range develop increasing
insight into the perspectives, motivations, and actions of their peers. They are increasingly disinterested in imagina-
tive play and gravitate to more competitive games and sports. Programming in this class can include activities and
games where there are definitive winners and losers (e.g. tag, races, and team games). While their coping skills are
considerably better than the preschool crowd, they can still struggle with differentiating “not winning” in a given
moment with failure as a person. At this age, positive reinforcement is still the most effective tool in your belt.

In all contexts, adolescence is the transition into adulthood. In terms of motor function, they have the essential skills
to perform any desired task but must repeatedly alter movement strategies due to the rapid changes in size and
configuration of their bodies inherent to puberty. Programming for the CrossFit Teens class includes all the move-
ments, skills, and exercises one might use with a typical adult client, appropriately scaled to their ability level on that
day. As emerging adults, teenagers are capable of logical, hypothetical, and abstract thought, although they may
struggle to separate the ideas from emotional influence. Socially, they are distancing themselves from their parents
but are still very susceptible to role modeling from adults in their lives, particularly those in an authoritative role. In
the Teens class we can begin to stretch our students outside of their comfort zone a little more in terms of the fatigue
and psychological challenges inherent to a difficult workout. In many cases we are not only focusing on their physical
development as individual humans, but also as athletes on the field of sport and competitors for success of all kinds
in the greater world around them.

COGNITIVE LEARNING STYLES: ALL BRAINS DO NOT WORK THE SAME WAY

While these “developmental norms” are a really helpful guideline for how to effectively frame your interactions with
different age groups, the importance of respecting their individual differences cannot be overstated. Just as we see
in adults, kids use multiple sensory systems to absorb and learn from their environment and many of us lean more
heavily on one system than the others. While it would be folly to assume a “cookie cutter” approach to teaching,
it is helpful to understand how each system contributes to information gathering to be sure we are covering all
of our bases.

Visual learners (2) primarily utilize mental pictures of events or written words for comprehension. They are particu-
larly observant of color and generally focus better if they are looking directly at a speaker. A person who favors visual
information may have trouble picking up on the nuances of verbal communication and can be easily distracted by

background noise. The whiteboard is a really good way to reach these individuals. Drawings paired with key words
and phrases, preferably in a variety of colors, will help them stay on track with your verbal instruction. The visual
depiction on the board should be complemented by a physical demonstration of movement so that there is a clear
representation of what the complete movement should look like in real time.

Auditory learners (3) are generally the ones who are always talking. Because they process information through
hearing and repeating and/or explaining concepts to themselves or others, these kids are really tuned into sound.
This is an important consideration during instructional time. The child who is continually asking questions or calling
out while you are teaching might be doing so for his or her own comprehension, but this could be easily interpreted
as disruptive or attention seeking behavior. Establishing a strategy for these kids might be as simple as asking them
to raise their hand or encouraging them to whisper to themselves versus calling out. Not surprisingly, background
noise can be very distracting for this group as well.

Kinesthetic learners (4) do not generally enjoy sitting still and are often labeled as hyperactive, but this may be
because they tend to be very physical in the way they interact with the world around them, both expressively and
receptively. They typically communicate emotion with their bodies as much or more than their words (gesturing,
hugging, etc.), and similarly, they learn best through physical movement and exploration. For the kinesthetic learners
in your class it is important to keep periods of instruction brief and to the point, and to mix active practice in with
verbal and visual instruction as much as possible. Another useful strategy is to allow younger kids who just can’t sit
still to be in the back of the group rocking or tapping as needed to stay focused without being overly distracting to
the rest of the class.

Obviously, it is no small task to keep all these factors in mind when you are teaching children and teens in your
classes, but simply being aware is a huge step in the right direction. By endeavoring to provide visual, auditory,
and kinesthetic experiences in your instruction, you can give any learner a solid chance at success. Certainly, this is
evidence to the fact that training kids is as much art as it is science.

MOTOR LEARNING: ESTABLISHING FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT STRATEGY

To further explain the progression of physical skills from the milestones chart above, it is helpful to understand a few
of the key sensory systems involved in the development of Neuromotor control (combined action of the neurolog-
ical and musculoskeletal systems to produce movement of the body). Because it is, ideally, a stepwise progression
of skills from birth to adulthood, there is value in looking at what should have already happened before kids walk in
the door of our CrossFit Kids Program (5). Please, bear in mind that these are simplified definitions of very complex
processes for the sake of brevity and readability (©).

The Vestibular System is the brain’s way of relating to gravity, and consequently the speed and direction of movement.
Aseries of fluid-filled canals with internal projections called hair cells residing in the inner ear give the brain informa-
tion about head position and movement. For example, if you are jumping on a trampoline, the vestibular system is
giving your brain constant information about which direction the body is leaning or moving so it can adjust appropri-
ately to avoid falling down.

Around the age of 2 months, babies begin demonstrating labyrinthine reflexes that alter body position in response
to gravity. These skills continue to emerge as the baby develops the strength and coordination to achieve more
challenging postures like sitting, quadruped (on hands and knees), and upright stance. It is important to understand
the codependence of these phenomena. Without adequate vestibular function, these positions cannot be achieved
due to loss of balance. However, without attempting to attain these positions through trial and error, babies do not
challenge the vestibular system to develop this level of communication with the brain. As kids achieve new motor
milestones (sitting, standing, walking, running, jumping, etc.) the amount of information the brain must process and
assimilate increases and the impact of any deficiencies also increases.

The Somatosensory System references the neurological receptors in the skin and soft tissue of the body that provide
information to the brain about pressure being applied to that tissue. If you are standing the middle of a room,
somatosensory receptors in your feet are informing your brain about how much pressure the floor is exerting on
you. Is your weight evenly distributed across the sole of the foot, or is your weight more towards one side, your toes,
or your heels? If you are holding an object or leaning against something, receptors in those areas of the body are also
providing information to help your body remain in balance.

Somatosensory information is critical to early movement strategy. Newborns have little to no volitional control over
the movement or position of their bodies. Initially, they must stay in whatever position they are placed until someone
moves them. Small children are, however, vehicles of discovery. As visual acuity improves and babies begin to be able
to see what is going on around them, curiosity takes over. They become impatient with whatever has been placed in
their visual field and will try to move to see something else. In prone (lying on the stomach) somatosensory receptors
in their arms, chest, and legs give them information about the supportive surface and they begin to push through
their arms to try to lift their heads off the floor to look around. They are rewarded by a whole new view on the world,
which motivates repeated practice until they master the skill. The learning progresses to include understanding of
weight shifting to unload a limb in order to reach or roll, or eventually step, run, and jump.

The definition of the Proprioceptive System is a subject of some debate. The formal definition includes multiple
types of sensory information originating from deeper structures within the body all of which contribute to postural
control and joint stability. The more commonly used definition in clinical environments is that proprioceptors carry
information regarding joint position and relative pressure within the joint. In this discussion, we will use the latter
definition. Joint capsules and ligaments provide structural stability to the joints, but are insufficient to fully prevent
excessive motion that can cause loss of balance or injury. Proprioceptors trigger rapid activation of muscles sur-
rounding the joint to compensate for asymmetrical forces on the joint surface (7). A simple analogy for how this
mechanism develops is learning to ride a bike. Initially, it is a challenge just to keep the bike on the correct half of

the road. However, with practice, you develop the ability to make small, essentially subconscious corrections to your
direction in order to keep the bike moving in a relatively straight line. Proprioceptors function in a similar way, via
small rapid corrections to keep the joints in-line and balanced. In early childhood development, proprioceptive input
is utilized in the same manner as somatosensory information. As the infant experiments with cause and effect of
various movements, the brain integrates proprioceptive information related to these movements and helps formu-
late more complicated movement strategies in the future.

All of the terms above contribute to overall body awareness, which is loosely defined as an understanding of where
one’s body is in space. It is a cognizance of the external boundaries and relative orientation of body parts to one
another. While this seems intuitive and obvious, it is startling how many children and adults have poor awareness of
their own physical form.

So far, we have only discussed the sensory side of Neuromotor control. All the above information is used by the brain
to figure out what the body should do at a given moment to accomplish a given task. Unless there is some underlying
dysfunction, the brain does this very efficiently. It then sends a message, via the neurological system, to the appro-
priate muscles to accomplish the desired action. The ability to activate the appropriate combination of muscles at the
ideal relative timing and intensity is generally known as coordination. There is considerable debate and discussion
about how coordinated movement is developed in early childhood. A theory that expands easily into later childhood
and adulthood is that coordinated movement is the result of the brain choosing the most efficient path based on
the set of internal and external constraints existing in that moment (8) (9) All of the above factors, combined with
bunch of the other 10 General Physical Skills (10) comprise the primary internal constraints on coordination of a given
movement or task.

External constraints represent the environment in which the movement is occurring, and would include things like
he firmness or evenness of the supportive surface, auditory or visual distractions, the weight and size of an object
‘0 be moved, the speed and direction it must go, and so on. In any given moment, the brain determines the most
efficient movement solution based on its understanding of the existing internal and external constraints. With time
and experience, the brain learns to anticipate movement requirements based on context, which leads to the develop-
ment of universal motor recruitment patterns; Rodolfo Llinas calls them fixed action patterns ("!) and in CrossFit we
ike to refer to them as functional movements ('2). As kids learn to squat, lift, push, pull, and jump inside our CrossFit
Kids Program, they are teaching their bodies how to move safely and efficiently in play, in sport, and in life.

The impact of modern technology on the physical demands of our lives is becoming evident in health trends related

‘o children and teens as much as their adult counterparts. Obesity, Type II Diabetes, Gross Motor Delay, Sensory Pro-
cessing Disorder, and attention and behavioral disabilities can all be linked to decreased amounts of physical activity

and play. It is important to note that the milestones and progressions discussed above are based on the assumption
that kids are getting appropriate amounts of physical, social, and cognitive interactions. The reality is that many do
not, and often, medical intervention is required to help get kids back on track. Across the age groups, the CrossFit
Kids Program is designed to provide age appropriate experiences for young people designed to facilitate normal
progression of these milestones.

OPTIMIZING THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Creating the culture you want inside of your classes sets you up to be successful over the long term. There are some
important considerations for structuring your classes and setting up your space that can really maximize the oppor-
tunities for both learning and fun.

Making sure students are grouped appropriately in terms of physical, cognitive, and emotional maturity is key, and
out of those three, physical development is potentially the least important. It is generally easier to scale around a
deconditioned or physically delayed child or teen than it is to help a someone who cannot understand the level of
instruction or is unable to handle the relative social/emotional tenor of the group. It is important to note that devel-
opment in these areas is far from linear. There will likely be considerable variance in each of these three parame-
ters within a given age group or even considerable discrepancy between relative maturity in each area for a given
child. Putting kids in the class that meets them where they are as an individual, versus what their chronological age
dictates, allows them to feel and, in turn, become successful. That being said, we have created some generalized age
groupings, which we will refer to as Preschool (Ages 3-5), Kids (Ages 5-12), and Teens (Ages 12-18) during the CrossFit
Kids Course. These should be thought of as general guidelines versus a prescription for inclusion or exclusion. A word
of caution: It might be tempting to combine age groups initially in order to maximize your resources and appease the
potential demand for a wide range of youth classes. However, referring back to the developmental milestone discus-
sion on pages 36 and 37, it is clear that it would be very difficult to keep teaching intervention age appropriate
across such a wide range of skills and the likely result is loss of interest in the kids on either end of the spectrum.

The benefits of small group training, especially at the beginning, are also worthy of discussion. The number of
demands on you as a coach in terms of the number of athletes you are trying to coach at once, the potential equip-
ment needs of those athletes, and the aforementioned opportunities for developmental variance are considerably
improved by keeping your classes small to start. Figuring out the rhythm of the class, what your particular group of
kids are motivated by, and building their knowledge base of the CrossFit movements and vernacular will take time
(and lots and lots of patience), not to mention, the more kids, of any age, that are present in a given space, the more
opportunities for distraction there will be. Ideally, the organic growth of the program mirrors the relative number
and skills of your training staff so that one never outpaces the other. Certainly, in most academic environments it is
not possible to limit class size, but for those who do have the ability to start with 3-5 students in one of the three age
groups, it is highly recommended.

The following chart includes suggested ideal ratios of trainers to athletes for the various age groups and some general
equipment recommendations as you build your program. It is important to note that a very successful CrossFit Kids
Program can be operated with little to no gear. However, these items will increase your options for programming and
skill development.

Ages Ratios Equipment Recommendations
Preschool 3-5 yrs 1:5 Cones, Ropes, Balls, Mats, Adjustable pull up bars
Kids 5-12 yrs | 1:10 + Light Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Medicine balls
Teens ya 1:15 + PVC, Barbells, other Adult Gear

You can find just about any equipment you could ever want online (i.e. Google “kids jump ropes”) but here are some
specific websites to get you started:

* Sportime (3)— www.sportime.com
* S&S Discount (14)— Sports, Games & PE Supplies—www.ssww.com/sports-pe-recreation/

* Rogue (15)— www.roguefitness.com

n addition to setting up your class structure for success, the way you use your workout space is also important;
endeavor to minimize distractions. If it is possible to schedule your youth classes for a time when no one else is in
he gym, it will certainly make things easier. That may not be a very realistic expectation for a lot of affiliates with
a full schedule of adult classes already in place, so making the best of the situation you are in is key. Traffic cones
or large equipment can be used to physically separate your youth classes from the rest of the gym environment.
During instructional periods, orient yourself or your demo so that kids have their backs to the rest of the room. Make
sure heavy or suspended equipment are out of reach in your teaching space or be sure to set up clear rules and
expectations about what gear kids are allowed to touch and when. A letter to parents, explaining your goals, training
approach, and rules for both participants and their parents is strongly recommended. Proactively setting expecta-

ions can save you some uncomfortable or difficult conversations when complications arise.

EFFECTIVE TEACHING STYLES

The very best information in the world loses its value if your audience doesn’t understand it or isn’t listening. Con-
sequently, the way you instruct inside of your classes is critical to the potential absorption and retention of your
message. We have already discussed the importance of addressing our visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners;
know that age is also a factor. As kids get older, the method of communication that gets the desired result changes
considerably. For example, rhyming words and animal sounds are generally appealing to the preschool set but may
be off-putting to older children and teens. On the flip side, sarcasm can be very useful in disarming teenagers but
could be quite confusing to a three year old. Age appropriate language conveys respect for their perspective on the
world and is foundational to establishing effective communication with your athletes.

One universal truth across all age groups is the value of focusing on the positive; almost everyone responds well to
genuine praise. While the majority of your communication must center around telling kids how to move correctly,
a single-minded focus on movement standards can make it difficult for them to remain interested in the learning
process. If, instead, we make a point of recognizing their successes, i.e. “Nice job keeping your heels down” or “Wow,
those are some fast elbows” it opens the door for any cue or correction that follows. Now they are interested in
hearing what they can do to earn more praise. In addition, when you do offer a correction, it is more effective to tell
them briefly and specifically how you want them to move versus telling them to stop doing whatever they are doing
wrong. For example: “keep your arms long as you stand up,” potentially gives them a much clearer path to success for
initiating a Med Ball Clean than “don’t bend your arms.” When they make an observable effort to accomplish a task
make sure you praise that effort, and when they do get it right definitely let them know!

The same strategy can be applied to affecting the behaviors, both positive and negative, that occur during class
time and, hopefully, beyond. Disruptions, disrespectful behavior, cheating, etc. are inevitable occurrences when
you are working with young people. How you choose to deal with them will determine whether they are occasional
hiccups or major roadblocks to your success. To explain this further, lets return to our discussion of the psychology
of learning and B.F. Skinner's ideas on Operant Conditioning (16), Reinforcing the behaviors you want to see (effort,
quality of movement, respect for others) via praise and opportunities for advancement makes it clear how to achieve
success in your class. Overtly condemning the behaviors we don’t want to see or punishing those behaviors (partic-
ularly with exercise) can have a profoundly negative impact on the “fun” factor in your classes. When a child or teen
displays negative behavior it is often an attempt to gain attention either from the trainer or from his or her peers. By
giving that person attention, you are, in effect, reinforcing the negative behavior. Overtly punishing the behavior with
exercise, i.e. assigning burpees or the infamous “go run a lap”, not only has the potential to foster a negative relation-
ship between trainer and athlete, but can also lead to a long term association of that exercise (or perhaps all exercise)
with getting in trouble and being unhappy, which is the exact opposite of pairing fitness with fun. If a behavior is
annoying but not a significant hindrance to the rest of the class, the best approach may be to simply ignore it and
continue praising the students who are demonstrating the desired behavior. Suppose a 10 year old is doing half the
stated repetitions in an attempt to impress everyone by finishing first but gains no recognition for doing so. While he
is waiting for everyone else to finish, he observes the rest of class getting lots of attention and praise for effort and
good mechanics. Over time, he learns what he needs to do to be included in that group. Perhaps a 5 year old in the
Preschool class routinely throws a temper tantrum when she does not get to be first in line. The trainer redirects her
to the end of the line with as little reaction as possible and then makes a point of praising the group for standing in
line patiently throughout the class. At some point, the little one will more than likely figure it out.

Optimizing the Child's Learning Environment, continued

If all else fails, and the behavior must be overtly addressed with a child in your Preschool or Kids class, the following
three-tiered approach is recommended:

* First, let the child know what the desired behavior is, i.e. “| need you to be quiet while | am explaining the
workout so that everyone can hear and understand. If | have to speak to you about it again, you will need
to sit out the first minute of game today.”

* If it continues, follow through with the consequence and let the child know they will miss the first minute
of game time.

* If it persists beyond that, the child may need to go see a parent.

Teenagers are often better served by a more hard line approach. A good rule of thumb is to be clear about your
expectations for behavior and then be consistent in how you choose to deal with failure to comply. It is also a very
good idea to outline all behavioral policies in your parent letter so that families understand the class expectations
and will be better equipped to support you in your efforts.

Offering choices versus ultimatums or refusals is also a very effective way to guide behavior in the direction you
would like it to go (17), As teachers, trainers, and most certainly as parents, it is easy to find yourself issuing a constant
stream of “don'ts” to the children in your care. Endeavor to give them viable options for what they can do. When kids
come into the gym before class, let them know where they can be and what they are allowed to touch. If at all possible,
give them more than one option; perhaps your gym has both a designated play area and a seating area away from
he workout space that they can safely be in. If there is not another class going on at that time, allow them a couple of
safe pieces of equipment to play with in the gym space: dodge balls, jump ropes, hula-hoops, etc. If you are teaching
in a school setting maybe they are allowed to shoot baskets or sit in the bleachers until the bell rings. More than
ikely, at some point you will have a child in your younger classes who struggles with complying with rules or perhaps
ries to bargain with trainers to change to an activity he or she prefers. Offering choices can be an effective form of
redirection. Perhaps a student in your Kids class is unhappy about having to use a dodge ball instead of a medicine
ball for the Wall Ball activity; letting him select the color of dodge ball he uses might be enough of a distraction to get
him re-engaged in the exercise. In some cases it’s as simple as offering kids the chance to sit and watch the activity
hey are resistant to. Often children realize before long that it is more fun to be doing the activity than watching it and
hey join back in on their own volition. Choices give both children and teens a sense of autonomy versus the sense of
being told what to do. As long as you only offer choices that are acceptable to you, everybody wins.

WORKING WITH SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Due to the infinite scalability of CrossFit, the CrossFit Kids Program has a unique ability to accommodate the needs of
young people with a broad array of physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities. Much the way we can configure a
workout like “Fran” to be safe and beneficial for anyone from an octogenarian to a professional athlete, we can adapt
any CrossFit Kids Workout for a child or teen with special needs. If you have the opportunity to work with kids with
special needs, you should embrace it, but first, do your homework. Learn what you can about that particular disabil-
ity and how it might impact programming decisions in terms of efficacy and safety. Parents are generally experts on
their child's medical situation and capabilities, so that is a great place to start.

It is very possible to provide an effective supplement to whatever clinical services children with physical disabilities
might be receiving during your CrossFit Kids classes. Many kids with long-term disability only have access to clinical
intervention for intermittent periods of time. A well-implemented program might be an excellent way to minimize
the amount of “lost ground” between treatment phases or even continue to make gains. The following are some
basic terms used to describe common aspects of physical disability and how they are relevant to your program-
ming decisions.

* Hypertonia is a condition caused by dysfunction in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
resulting in an overactive neuromuscular response and increased resistance to muscle stretch. Clinically
it is often referred to as “spasticity” or “high tone” and is essentially a perpetual or fluctuating involuntary
muscle contraction. Despite this state of near constant muscle activation, individuals with hypertonia are
typically very weak in voluntary contraction of the affected muscle groups as well as the muscle groups
that move the joint in the opposite direction.

Programming Recommendation: Closed chain exercises (connected to surface not free in space) targeting
the muscles that work in opposition to the affected muscles. For example, if an individual has increased
biceps tone, elevated push-ups or planks would challenge the triceps in a weight bearing position but keep
the relative intensity of the exercise at an appropriate level.

* Hypotonia is symptomatically opposite to hypertonia and can be caused by a wide array of medical
issues. Individuals with low muscle tone have slow or inefficient communication between the nerves
and the muscles leading to poor muscular recruitment, decreased joint stability, decreased balance and
coordination, and as a result, increased risk of injury.
Programming Recommendation: Lots of midline stabilization exercises. Static holds will be very challenging
but beneficial so find a way to make them fun (think Plank Games!)

* Paraplegia refers to decreased ability to move and/or receive sensory information from the lower half of
the body. Sensorimotor loss can be complete or partial.
Programming Recommendations: Depending on the level of injury, the individual may or may not be able
to sit without support. If he or she is able, have them sit without back support for upper body exercises to
increase the work at midline. If the individual generally uses a wheelchair for mobility, transitions in and out
of the chair might be a suitable substitute for squats (just make sure the breaks are on)

* Quadriplegia refers to decreased sensorimotor function that includes both the upper and lower
extremities and sometimes the head and neck as well.
Programming recommendations: Because this condition limits the use of essentially the entire body, it is
one of the few conditions that might be very difficult to scale for inside of your program. However, the social
benefits of inclusion might outweigh the minimal physiological impact we can expect, making it a worth-
while endeavor.

For additional information on working with individuals with physical disabilities, the Crossroads Adaptive Athletic
Alliance (18) is a great resource. Local pediatric rehabilitation facilities might also be able to offer educational
opportunities.

Children and teens with cognitive delays may have difficulty keeping up with the pace and demands of the class gen-
erally associated with their age group. Scaling the complexity of movements or simplifying the rep scheme for that
athlete will help them keep up with the class. For example: if the Workout in your Teens class is 15-12-9 of pull-ups
and hang squat cleans, an appropriate scale might be 10-10-10 pull-ups and front squats. In some cases, placing
the athlete in class designed for a younger age group might be the best solution. Often, in this population, cognitive
maturity and emotional maturity are relatively on par. A 14 year old with Down syndrome might be more comfort-
able and have more fun in your Kids class than in the Teens program. Obviously, relative safety awareness and size
of the student are important considerations when planning games and team workouts.

Children and teens diagnosed with behavioral disorders or Autism Spectrum disorders can be significantly challenged
by large group activities like recreational sports and traditional physical education classes. This is due in part to their
unique perspective on the world around them and also to the prevalence of sensory processing issues (19) within
his population. The predictability and scalability of the age appropriate CrossFit Kids format can enable these kids
0 participate without feeling over stimulated. Each section of the class occurs in a consistent order for a relatively
consistent amount of time and can be anticipated. By giving kids permission to sideline themselves whenever they
are feeling tired, overwhelmed, or just need a little personal space, you can make it possible for them to choose when
0 go a outside of their comfort zone versus forcing them into a potentially stressful environment. Of all the man
ypes of special needs the kids in your program might bring to your classes, those with behavioral issues will probab
challenge your patience and creativity the most, but also present the greatest opportunities for life altering growth.

ly
y

For all the possible health benefits of providing a safe, fun, and engaging environment for kids with special needs
0 participate in exercise activity, the real prize is the social and emotional benefits of inclusion. Many of these kids
spend much of their lives in clinical environments working one on one with doctors, therapists, and other medical
professionals. While the value of these interventions cannot be overstated, at some point, inevitably, it can start to
feel like work. Your CrossFit Kids Program might be one of the first opportunities for young people with special needs
and their families to experience some normalcy; a place where they can have typical social interactions with their
peer group and to just get to be a kid.

CONCLUSION

In the end, the key to running a successful CrossFit Kids Program is finding the right trainer for the job and providing
them with the education they need to thrive. Understanding the various stages of the developmental process and
the factors that heavily influence learning is a great foundation to build on. A trainer who can muster the patience,
enthusiasm, and flexibility to adapt to the variable perspectives and constantly changing needs of a diverse group of
young people will be well equipped to steer them down the path to success.

CROSSFIT KIDS NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE

INTRODUCTION

Establishing nutrition and lifestyle behaviors that support a healthy life is an enormous responsibility parents have
owards their children. What children learn to eat and what habits they acquire may be perpetuated into adulthood,
dramatically affecting quality of life. This critical task is often made more difficult by the daunting amount of informa-
ion and opinions on the topic, as well as the perception that better needs to be more expensive. Because parents
may not have the time to study the newest research or cost compare with every trip to the market, this brief primer
ogether with the resources that follow, as well as the information presented at the CrossFit Kids Course, are meant
‘0 assist parents and CrossFit Kids Trainers alike. Foundational concepts are presented that lead to a minimal set of
aspects to move towards prioritizing. Specifically, calorie counting is not the best option nor is replacing real food
with distilled or re-amalgamated versions of it. Instead, children should be taught how to make the best food and
drink choices possible and that appropriate sleep and recovery are just as important as exercise; these are lifestyle
lessons than can be learned at home and within a CrossFit Kids program.

INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTS

Calories

Simply put, we need food and water to provide energy and raw materials to sustain our existence (1). The widely used
energy balance model simply subtracts your daily total energy expenditure (calories) from your total daily intake
of nutrients (calories) to determine your daily weight change, complying with the First Law of Thermodynamics.
However, how much of a caloric deficit is required to lose a pound of body weight is not a straightforward calculation.
Hall (2) concludes that initial body fat and the amount of weight already lost can dramatically influence the often-
quoted value of 3500 kcal per pound. Beyond just one’s intake and expenditure, Hall (2) states “resistance exercise
or high protein diets may modify the proportion of weight loss resulting from body fat versus lean tissue.” And
therefore suggests that “a more comprehensive model of macronutrient metabolism and body composition change
would be required to model such factors” (2). Indeed, Thomas (3) discusses the impact of additional factors that may
confuse the issue, such as: metabolic adaptations, non-exercise activity, and dietary compensation. Finally, Ebbeling
(4) showed that “commonly consumed diets can affect metabolism and components of the metabolic syndrome
in markedly different ways during weight-loss maintenance, independent of energy content.” Rather than being a
simple physics or math problem, understanding the connection between what we eat and tissue changes (and the
resulting health effects) is a complex systems biology question.

Panaceas

Some mass media campaigns claim the advantages of single nutrients that provide near complete health or reme-
diation from illness. The vast majority are marketed as supplements and therefore under no obligation to conduct
any scientific research in order to make those statements. Some of those with a research backing and implemented
by governments have resulted in a beneficial effect on global health, such as the iodization of salt that prevents its
deficiency. Limiting iodine reduces the synthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4; in adults this can lead to goiter
and mental impairment. Improper levels of thyroid hormones in developing fetuses and children can impair proper
brain development. The global, positive health repercussions from the addition of a single element to a food product
as ubiquitous as salt are an impressive accomplishment. Equally impressive are other well thought out attempts that
have lead to failures. For example the use of vitamin B9 (folate), vitamin C, and vitamin E for cardiovascular disease
prevention or beta-carotene and vitamin A to reduce the risk of lung cancer in smokers (5,6). Potential reasons for
these discrepancies in general, include nutrient toxicity, metabolic interferences, bioavailability, and bioactivity (5).

CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

CrossFit Kids Nutrition and Lifestyle, continued

In the case of lung cancer prevention with beta-carotene and vitamin A, trials were begun because “a large body of
observational epidemiologic studies has consistently demonstrated that individuals eating more fruits and vege-
tables (which are rich in carotenoids) and people having higher serum-carotene levels have a lower risk of cancer,
particularly lung cancer” (7). However, results from two separate studies showed an increase in the appearance of
lung cancer in smokers who were supplemented with vitamin A and beta-carotene (7,8). While beta-carotene is an
important nutrient (perhaps most notably as a precursor to vitamin A) it appears that tobacco smoke acts antago-
nistically (especially at high doses) with the molecule in lung tissue. Russell (7) states, “we had better understand the
metabolism and breakdown of natural products, and have thoroughly tested them at various doses in appropriate
animal models, before embarking on large-scale intervention trials, particularly when using unusually high doses
that greatly exceed normal dietary levels of the product.” Indeed, Lichtenstein (5) concludes “there are insufficient
data to justify an alteration in public health policy from one that emphasizes a food-based diet to fulfill nutrient
requirements and promote optimal health outcomes to one that emphasizes dietary supplementation.”

A model

It would therefore seem that the consumption of varied, nutrient-rich real foods is a much more sound general
approach and prescription. The optimal ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, and protein) could theoretically be
determined for any health effect (fat loss, longevity, cancer prevention, athletic performance, etc.) if it were possible
to conduct experiments on humans as has been done with laboratory mice subjected to 25 different diets (9). Lacking
this long-term empirical population-based data, CrossFit recommends for everyone to optimize their own ratios
(starting with those recommended by Dr. Barry Sears 40/30/30), by weighing and measuring food, and eating “meat
and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise
but not body fat.” Together with the main focus of CrossFit, i.e, general physical preparedness, this prescription
overlaps with that suggested by Wells (10), “Avoid refined carbohydrates and get fit to boost metabolic flexibility.”

Wells (10) discusses a model that suggests a diet rich in refined carbohydrates is the direct cause of hyperinsulinemia
and fat deposition. This initial metabolic and hormonal derangement, then progresses over time to insulin resistance,
reduced glucose tolerance, leptin resistance, increased stress, and loss of sleep. These resulting conditions lead to
feelings of increased hunger and lethargy, ultimately creating a positive energy balance and a feed forward loop. In
other words, food choice perturbs metabolism, causing behaviors that result in further weight gain; rather than an
energy imbalance itself being initially causal.

This model was put forth earlier to explain childhood obesity (11,12,13,14). In these articles Lustig describes the
interaction between molecular components and systemic processes that result in modified behaviors. Leptin is a
hormone that signals energy sufficiency; it reduces the neurological reward for food (13) and allows for “the initia-
tion of high-energy processes” (11). Hyperinsulinemia is a response to chronically elevated blood sugar; it triggers
an energy storage response, resulting in obesity (13). Elevated insulin can also antagonize leptin action, conveying a
false “starvation” signal and increasing positive feelings about food (11,12,13,14); perpetuating a cycle of maladapta-
tion. These concepts are complex. The interactions between our environment, genes, actions, choices, hormones,
metabolism, organs, and even our microbiome (15,16,17,18,19,20) make nutrition a difficult topic to talk about with
adults, let alone children.

The “metabolic perturbation model” (10) just described is not necessarily mutually exclusive with the energy balance

model. Indeed, energy balance is part of it; however, this model also informs a more approachable way to begin
discussing and making lifestyle changes. Rather than immediately and severely curtailing intake amount and dramat-

ically increasing the volume of exercise, an alternative first step could be to simply reduce intake of foods that lead
to problematic metabolic and subsequent behavioral outcomes. This short-term achievable adjustment is important
because long-term changes require an initial belief that lifestyle adjustments are possible as well as a subsequent
adherence to that chosen path (21).

A path forward

CrossFit Kids does not recommend an immediate wholesale change of dietary intake or nutritional behaviors. Similar
to the long-term plan for movement, there should be an extended strategy for affecting eating habits within this
program. Specifically, begin by informing. Simply providing information such as food identification and macronu-
trient classes. Then transition to educating, facilitating a deeper understanding of the effects of various foods, for
example how they make us feel and impact performance. CrossFit Kids Trainers should adhere to a long-term cur-
riculum of instruction, combined with a short-term mandate to celebrate every success made by the children in
the program. Praise wisely, the process or journey, in order to engender perseverance and further improvement
(http://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck the power of believing that_you_can_improve?language=en#t-298029—
accessed 4/2015).

This strategy must involve the parents or caregivers as well. The goal is to have entire families strive to make the
best choices concerning food that they can: maximizing nutrient complexity, minimizing the insulin response,
while providing appropriate amounts of essential nutrients. They should also understand the role hydration
plays in health and appreciate that sleep and recovery are complementary aspects to exercise and performance,
not detractors.

MINIMAL COMPONENTS TO CONSIDER
The following section covers the broad themes that CrossFit Kids suggests guide your curriculum and actions con-
cerning nutrition within the program.

Making Best Choices

Rather than prescribe a set of rules to adhere to, our ultimate goal is to have children and their families make the best
choices they can about the foods they eat in every situation. The ultimate desire may be to maintain a diet that: is low
to moderate in carbohydrate (to reverse or prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes, respectively)(22), provides the rest
of the dietary calories through protein as well as fat, has an omega-6:0mega-3 fatty acid ratio less than 5, and encom-
passes all of the essential nutrients. However, for CrossFit Kids, the primary (and sometimes only) suggestion is to
choose real foods over processed foods for every meal. This simple choice nearly eliminates refined sugars from
the diet, decreases omega-6 fatty acid consumption (and with grassfed beef or wild caught fish, increases omega-3
fatty acids), while providing a complex set of vital nutrients.

This first, simple best choice of real foods is consistent with the ideas of Lustig and Wells outlined above and takes
into account the fact that family life is hectic; rules established in a diet can lead to unnecessary stress about failure
or even portion size. Our role is to help families make these choices; they will feel better, want to be more active, and
become healthier. Resources at the end of this section are provided for you to use for yourselves as well as to assist
families: cookbooks, recipes, nutrition websites, books, and videos. The greatest impact we can potentially make is to
start children on a path of choosing wisely as early as possible (23), even in utero (24) and pre-weaning (25). Allowing
an opportunity for children to identify and taste real foods is something that can occur within a CrossFit Kids class;
when the famous chef Jamie Oliver did this he had some amazing reactions (65). Learning early to appreciate what

METHODOLOGY CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

CrossFit Kids Nutrition and Lifestyle, continued

real foods are and what they taste like is a foundation that can last a lifetime.

Hydration

In Waterlogged (26), Noakes states, “even though we are less able to replace our (larger because we sweat) water
deficits as they develop through exercise, we are better adapted for prolonged exercise in the heat than those
mammals who do not develop voluntary dehydration” (p28). Indeed, military studies in the Nevada desert observed,
“no immediate health risk associated with the level of dehydration of 7% to 10%" (26; p48). Results from prolonged
endurance races show that runners who are the most dehydrated at the finish ran the fastest (26). Additionally, hypo-
hydration does not affect cramp susceptibility (27,28)

CrossFit Kids therefore recommends that children drink when they are thirsty (64). Humans are capable of making up
water deficits at the end of the day (26). The preference is that children choose water over carbohydrate-laden bev-
erages and dilute electrolyte-infused beverages. We highly encourage children (and families) to avoid energy drinks
altogether, these drinks have varying amounts of caffeine, some staggeringly high (29). Emergency department visits
involving energy drinks and caffeine toxicity are on the rise for 12-18 year olds (66). “Serious adverse effects have
been reported when consumed in larger doses, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults with anxiety,
seizures, agitation, migraines, sleeplessness, dehydration, gastrointestinal problems, arrhythmias, and other cardiac
events” (30). There are no benefits to these energy drinks that a varied diet, sleep and water don't provide.

Omega-6:0mega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio

A varied diet ensures consumption of components that humans cannot synthesize themselves, such as essential
amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Another class of required compounds is the essential fatty acids: the omega-3
fatty acid, alpha-linolenic and the omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid. Humans evolved under conditions where the
overall omega-6:0mega-3 fatty acid ratio of consumed foods was approaching 1:1, whereas today’s Western diet
skews that ratio to ~15:1 (31). This dramatic increase in omega-6 fatty acids with our diets

“May have negative consequences for metabolic health. These concerns are based on the biological
actions of omega-6 [linoleic acid; 18:2(n-6) and derivatives thereof], which are largely proinflammatory,
prothrombotic and proadipogenic. It has been suggested that increases in omega-6 PUFA intake over
the past few decades may be an important factor contributing to the current obesity epidemic.” (32)

This abnormal ratio can even affect babies in utero because “placental fatty acid transfer shows considerable depen-
dence on maternal plasma fatty acids, and is not regulated to protect the fetus from high maternal omega-6 fatty
acids, or low DHA” (33). Additionally, the problem exists in infancy where a mother’s milk may have an increased
percentage of omega-6 fatty acids because of her consumption habits; alarmingly, even commercial infant formulas
have been sold with increased amounts of omega-6 fatty acids (34).

Normalizing the omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratio can be accomplished by reducing the quantity of consumed
omega-6 fatty acids. Items with the highest levels are certain vegetable oils (67); these oils are prevalent in processed
as well as fried food. Consuming real foods rather than these packaged or fried varieties can be a straightforward
first step in limiting the intake a large concentrated dose of omega-6 fatty acids as well as trans fatty acids. Additional
efforts can be made to actively increase the quantity of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Foods with the highest levels
of omega-3 fatty acids are fish (67) and this graphical chart may also help with choosing a type (68). The essential
nature of both the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids as well as the reported associated effects of a skewed ratio

makes knowing the quantities present in the foods we commonly eat an important metric to monitor in order to
make accurate adjustments and assess outcomes.

Many studies have investigated the health benefits of reducing the omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratio by increasing
the amount of certain omega-3 fatty acids through supplementation, specifically: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Research has even looked into the effect these compounds (especially DHA) may have
on children’s health and development, for example: lipid profiles (35), asthma (36), cognitive dysfunction (37,38),
memory (39,40), and cardiovascular diseases (36). The results of these studies are varied in outcomes and predictive
power. Intake guidelines for EPA and DHA have been established based on an even larger set of studies; international
recommendations can be found here (69) , for the United States here (70) and then summarized here (71). CrossFit
Kids suggests similar guidelines as in these reports, from 0.5 g per day for children to upwards of 3 g per day for the
oldest teenagers however, the lack of (and difficulty of establishing) well designed, large, and long-term interventional
studies makes the suggestion of supplementation secondary to focusing on improving dietary practices (34,41).

Sleep
The necessity of sleep is underscored by the fact that sleep deprivation

“Reduces learning, impairs performance in cognitive tests, prolongs reaction time, and is a common
cause of seizures. In the most extreme case, continuous sleep deprivation kills rodents and flies within
a period of days to weeks. In humans, fatal familial or sporadic insomnia is a progressively worsening
state of sleeplessness that leads to dementia and death within months or years.” (42)

Furthermore, sleep is a time during which growth hormone is secreted; repairing damage from the day's activities or
as part of the normal developmental growth program of children (43,44). More recent research also shows that sleep
allows clearance of metabolites and toxins from the brain (42,45,46). Besides these biological examples there was a
positive relationship reported between fatigue-related injuries and children experiencing less than 6 hours of sleep
the night before a sporting event (47).

Ina literature survey, Youngstedt (48) found that “exercise was associated with small-to-moderate effects” on various
aspects of sleep and that “exercise could be a healthy, safe, inexpensive, and simple means of improving sleep”
(49). Interestingly, there appears to be a bi-directionality between sleep and obesity. “Experimentally imposed sleep
debt, for example, has been shown to perturb carbohydrate metabolism, with reduced glucose tolerance and raised
evening levels of cortisol” (10). Obesity, on the other hand, is associated with an increased risk of sleep apnea, further
deteriorating quality sleep and setting up a recursive cycle (50). Therefore, letting parents know the necessity of sleep
for their children and that exercise is a means to achieve better sleep are additional important topics to improve

overall health.

Recovery

Like sleep, recovery is not specifically about nutrition, it too represents a behavior that is foundational to optimal
performance in sport and life. Allowing time off can help prevent overuse injuries (51,52). Some sports have seasons
that continue throughout the year, creating the perfect environment for repetitive motion injuries in those children
that choose or are told to participate and therefore specialize for a prolonged period (53). Farrey (53) states:

“Early specialization can cause mental exhaustion and, as a child gets older, overuse injuries. With
orthopedists seeing a rise in joint injuries involving preteen athletes over the past decade the [American
Academy of Pediatrics] now formally opposes specialization before a child reaches puberty.” (65)

Providing recovery time, whether it is resting, switching to a different sport, or the participating in a general physical
preparedness program like CrossFit Kids can reduce the risk of the injuries described above as well as improve their
overall fitness and motor coordination (54). It is the responsibility of the CrossFit Kids Trainer to assess the need for
recovery in individuals within the program, either by knowing their other commitments or monitoring performance.

Interestingly, the importance of recovery in this longer-term time frame is juxtaposed with the innate ability of
healthy adolescents to recover within short-term activity bouts. Children appear to have a higher resistance to
fatigue than adults (55,56,57). Reasons for this difference have been ascribed to differences in energy substrate
utilization (58,59,60,61), increased type-| muscle recruitment, and increased phosphocreatine regeneration (62).
These features, together with the established mechanics and consistency make teens the most appropriate group to
provide the health benefits associated with high-intensity exercise (63).

strips to the pan without crowding it. Cook for about 1 minute on both sides. You may need to do this in 2-3
batches depending how big the strips are. Place the strips on a cooling rack that has been placed on top of
a baking sheet. This will help the chicken strips cook on both sides without getting soggy. If you don’t have a
cooling sheet, you will just have to flip them half way through the baking. Place baking sheet in the oven and
cook for 10-12 minutes or until no pink remains inside the chicken. Let cool on baking sheet before serving.

PROTECTING CROSSFIT KIDS FROM PREDATION

“The decision to have a child is momentous because it is to decide forever to have your heart go walking
around outside your body.”
—Elizabeth Stone

As CrossFit Kids trainers, the gravity of teaching children is fully within our direct influence. We must protect and
mitigate risk to kids’ well-being while under our care at the gym, and we further must educate both them and their
primary care-givers to help protect throughout the other 23 hours of the day. Through mentorship, education,
awareness, and training, we have the opportunity to make a dramatic impact upon our kids’ safety.

CHILD-ABUSE PREVENTION
By: Todd Rakos, CrossFit Kids Magazine, September—October 2009

Most of you who are running a CrossFit Kids program are doing so because you have a genuine interest in helping
children; unfortunately that is not true for everyone. | would like to spend a little time to educate you on what to look
for in the area of child abuse that will hopefully give you the tools to spot abuse and help limit your liability as a child
instructor.

Most states have laws that require certain occupations—like teachers, health-care professionals, social workers,
and members of law enforcement—to report suspected child abuse when they encounter it. | feel, however, that is
the duty of all adults regardless of their profession to make such a report (Canada already has such a requirement).

There are two basic types of child abuse—sexual and physical—and for both types the abusers can be men or
women. About 90 percent of the time the abuser is a family member or relative.

SEXUAL ABUSE INDICATORS

There are several indicators you may see in a child that might indicate sexual abuse; some are more obvious than
others. Obviously if a child complains of pain or bleeding in the anal or genital area, you should be concerned, but
the child might not verbalize this; you might only notice the child has difficulty walking or sitting. While children seem
to have knowledge about sex at an ever-decreasing age, you still should be concerned if a child has an inappropriate
knowledge about sex. You should also be concerned if the child tends to have inappropriate play with toys, him- or
herself or others, or seems overly affectionate. Sexually abused children often have poor peer relationships. They
have been taught that sexual contact is normal, and when they try to transfer that conduct to their peers, they
become ostracized. Lastly, you should be wary of a sudden, unexplained change of behavior. Why has your normal
student suddenly started acting differently? Maybe the single parent is dating someone new, or a new person has
moved into the neighborhood and the abuse has just started.

PHYSICAL ABUSE INDICATORS

Again there are several indicators you might see in a child who is being physically abused. The most obvious are
unexplained injuries or explanations of injuries that are inconsistent with the injury. You might also find that the child
is frightened of a parent or caretaker and is afraid to go home after class or is wary of all adult contact. As is the case
with sexual abuse, a sudden change in behavior or performance might indicate a new dynamic in the child's life. You

CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

will also find that a victim of physical abuse often has a poor self-image and is subject to behavioral extremes. The
child has been told he is no good and is desperately trying different behaviors in an attempt to find the one behavior
that will be met with acceptance.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO

There are several things | recommend you do to help protect the children you teach. First, have a set of safety rules in
place and make sure all of your trainers are aware of them and follow them. Require your parents to get out of their
cars and walk inside your facility to drop off and pick up their children. When teaching classes, always do it in the open
and have a place where parents can sit and watch the class and feel comfortable. Establish safe areas in your facility.
Children often come early to class or are sometimes picked up late. Have a designated area where they are to wait
during this time. This area should be out in the open where they can be observed by you and your trainers. Have a
well-established presence in your facility. Know when someone new walks in and greet him or her promptly. Be aware
of what happens in and around your facility. Know if one of your adult clients seems to always be hanging around
after class to watch the children’s class or is always hanging around in the parking lot. And lastly, if you suspect abuse,
report it to your local law enforcement and child protective agencies. These reports can be made anonymously if you
are more comfortable that way. Often we as a society tend to suppress our natural ability to know when something
does not look right. We rationalize it away and then later say we did not feel right about somebody but were afraid to
offend. Remember, it is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to protecting children.

CHILD INTERNET SAFETY

Next | would like to talk about Internet safety for children and what parents should look for to help keep their children
safe. | will talk about signs that your child might be at risk, methods abusers use to get child victims, and tips you can
use to protect your child. The Internet has become the newest way for adult abusers to locate potential child victims.
Where an adult abuser used to have to venture out in public and risk being noticed, he can now troll the Internet
in anonymity.

SIGNS THAT A CHILD MIGHT BE AT RISK

You should be wary if your child spends large amounts of time on the Internet, especially at night. Like most adults,
abusers also work during the day, so it is the nighttime that they have free to look for victims. You should also be con-
cerned if you discover large amounts of pornography on your computer. Predators will often send pornography to
children as a way of making it seem normal. An at-risk child might also receive phone calls from unknown numbers—
sometimes long distance—or will receive gifts or packages from someone the parent doesn’t know. You should be
concerned if the child suddenly turns off the computer or changes screens when you enter the room or you discover
they are using an Internet account that belongs to someone else. It is also important to be aware if the child suddenly
becomes withdrawn from the family; remember, the predator wants to be the child’s best friend and confidant, and
the best way to do this is to get the child less dependent on you as the parent.

GROOMING

“Grooming” is the term used to describe the way predators use to get to their victims. It is simple manipulation of the
victim and their way to get from bad intention to sexual exploitation. It often involves flattery, sympathy, or offers of
gifts, money, or jobs. Its intent is to make the victim feel loved or comfortable enough to meet in person. Remember,
while the predator is enjoying his online time, his ultimate goal is to meet the child in person.

METHODOLOGY CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

Protecting CrossFit Kids From Predation, continued

The predator will often first meet the victim in a public chat room but will soon ask to go to a private chat area. They
will then ask the victims questions to get to know them better. They will ask where the computer is located in the
house so they can determine the risk of a parent watching the conversation. Then they will want to know the child’s
interests or favorite bands, designers, or films. They will often use this information to send the victim gifts. Predators
will often offer to help the victims get jobs or money as a way of ingratiating themselves into the child's life. Ultimately,
they will ask for the child's phone number as a way to make the contact more personal. If none of these tactics seem
to be getting the predator closer to an in-person meeting, they may finally result to threats. They will threaten to tell
the child’s parents or make public the private conversations the child has been sharing.

PARENT TIPS

So what can parents do to help protect their children? The most important thing is to talk to your children. In an
age-appropriate manner, warn them of adult predators and the grooming methods they employ. Set reasonable
rules and guidelines for their Internet usage. Know your child’s friends. Is there some new friend in your child's life
that they are reluctant to talk about? Are the friends your child used to have no longer coming around (remember, the
predator is trying to come between the child and everyone else)? And lastly, investigate. Monitor the websites your
child goes to; learn how to check the computer's history. Check your child’s cell phone and bill for unknown numbers
or suspicious or coded text messages. Look in your child’s room. Parents often try too hard to be a child's friend
instead of a parent. It is your job to protect as best you can, while that may be upsetting to the child now, in the long
run he or she will thank you for it.

8 RED FLAGS FOR IDENTIFYING CHILD PREDATORS
By: Yello Dyno, Protecting Children from Child Predators, www.yellodyno.com

1) If someone enjoys being around your child more than you do.

2) Amuch older child or adult spends excessive amounts time with your child.

3) Your child has new toys or gifts you did not buy.

4) Your child speaks knowledgeably of places and activities you did not introduce him or her to.

5) Aperson continually offers to care for your child to give you a “breather” or time for yourself. (He or she
often does not want payment for watching your child).

6) Aperson comes to your house regularly to spend time with or transport your child to activities.

7) Aperson engages in activities that involve only him/herself and your child; activities that do not require
others to be present.

8) Aperson is preoccupied with and/or stares at your child.

THE TEST OF TWELVE
By: Gavin de Becker, Protecting the Gift, 1999

Do your children know...

1) How to honor their feelings—if someone makes them uncomfortable, that’s an important signal;

2) You (the parents) are strong enough to hear about any experience they've had, no matter how unpleasant;

3) It's OK to rebuff and defy adults;

4) It's OK to be assertive;

5) How to ask for assistance or help;

6) How to choose who to ask;

7) How to describe their peril;

8) It’s OK to strike, even to injure, someone if they believe they are in danger, and that you'll support any
action they take as a result of feeling uncomfortable or afraid;

9) It’s OK to make noise, to scream, to yell, to run;

10) If someone ever tries to force them to go somewhere, what they scream should include, “This is not my
father!” (because onlookers seeing a child scream or even struggle are likely to assume the adult is a
parent);

11) If someone says “Don't yell,” the thing to do is yell (and the corollary: If someone says “Don't tell,” the thing
to do is tell);

12) To fully resist ever going anywhere out of public view with someone they don’t know, and particularly to
resist going anywhere with someone who tries to persuade them.

MOVEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this section is to provide an organized, easy-to-reference, uniform method of teaching children’s cues
for the 10 CrossFit Kids Foundational Movements (the 9 Foundational Movements from the CrossFit Level 1 Certifi-
cate Course, plus the thruster). In this document, the term “CrossFit Kids” will reference all children 3-18 years of age.
Some cues and teaching methods will vary across the CrossFit Kids age spectrum (Preschool: ages 3-5; Kids: ages
5-12; Teens: ages 12-18) due to proven effectiveness with a particular age group, and the specific class designator will
be used in that particular case.

It is imperative when teaching children to be very clear and descriptive (yet simple) in explaining movement and
instruction. Four universally successful teaching methods are:
1) Give children information where to start, where to go, and where to finish every movement.
2) All movements, regardless of age group, begin unloaded (nothing in their hands) before subsequent load
(PVC pipe or more) is used.
3) Tell children what you want them to do, as opposed to what you do not want them to do; i-e., “Stand all the
way up at the top of the squat” instead of “Don’t short the top of the squat.”
4) Try to teach and cue children as a class. Most children do not want to be separated from the group; be very
careful with singling them out. Instead, endeavor to give cues and corrections that can be performed with
multiple athletes participating.

We have found these four general methods to be very effective. You will most certainly have other methods—just
be sure to always make it fun; a child's lifelong outlook of fitness is being forged by a coach's approach to training.

SQUAT

SQUAT TEACHING POINTS
There are four primary teaching points:
1. Stance
2. Hips Back
3. Bottom Position
4. Finish Position

1. Stance—This is where to start

Adult Cue
Feet shoulder width apart, toes slightly turned out, weight rooted through the heels.

Preschool and Kids Cue
Thumbs on outside of shoulders, match heels to thumbs (and/or tape on ground about 12” apart and match
heels to the tape).

Teens Cue
Thumbs on the outside of shoulders, match heels to thumbs (and/or tape on the ground about 18” apart and
match heels to the tape.

2. Hips Back

Adult and Teens Cue
Butt back and down.

CrossFit Kids Cue
Hips back.
Have the CrossFit Kid(s) put their hands out and then grab their hips; explain that these are their hips. Then, tell-
ing them to keep their chest up and knees straight, have them push their hips back and re-stand, bending only
at the hip. Ensure the hips are doing the moving backwards and forwards, not the chest falling and rising.

3. Bottom Position—This is where to go

Adult and Teens Cue
Crease of the hip below the knee.

CrossFit Kids Cue
Pockets below the knees.
Have the kids interlock their thumbs and push their arms straight out in front of their body so the hands make
a butterfly (rockets, eagles, block out the sun, etc.) in front of their face. Then repeat the “hips back” drill from
above several times, this time with arms raised. Then have them push their hips back and sit down so the pock-
ets are below the knees.

4. Finish Position—This is where to finish
Adult and Teens Cue
Stand all the way up/knees and hips fully open at the top with a neutral spine and body bisected by the
frontal plane.
CrossFit Kids Cue
Stand up like a superhero.
Have the CrossFit Kid(s) stand tall and the end of the movement, chest out like a superhero and hands on hips.

FRONT SQUAT

FRONT SQUAT TEACHING POINTS
There are two primary teaching points:
1. Air Squat
2. Rack Position

1. Squat
The font squat builds off the mechanics of the squat; nothing discussed in the squat changes. Start the front
squat by reviewing the squat, and remind Kids and Teens the front squat is the receiving position for the
Olympic clean.

2. Rack Position—This is where to start/finish

Adult Cue
Bar racked on shoulders, hands outside shoulders, loose fingertip grip on barbell, elbows high with upper
arm parallel to the ground.

Preschool and Kids Cue
Unloaded or dumbbell only. Hands on shoulders, pretend elbows are lasers, point lasers at targets
on the wall.

THRUSTER

THRUSTER TEACHING POINTS
There are three primary teaching points:
1. Front Squat
2. Press
3. Linking the Front Squat and the Press

1. Front Squat—This is where to start/finish
The thruster builds off the mechanics of the front squat; nothing discussed in the front squat changes. Start the
thruster by reviewing the front squat.

2. Press—This is where to go
After the front squat, the thruster then builds off the mechanics of the press; nothing discussed in the press
changes. Once they have reviewed the front squat, continue working on the thruster by reviewing the press.

3. Linking the Front Squat and Press
To link the front squat and press, affix numbers to portions of the movements, thus creating an easily communi-
cated partition to the sequencing of movement to be gone over one piece at a time:
1. Standing in the front squat rack position to bottom of the front squat
2. Bottom of the front squat to the top of the front squat
3. Elbows from front squat to press position, and press to overhead
4. Overhead back to front squat rack position.
Once this sequence is learned it can be simplified:
1. Standing in the front squat rack position to bottom of the front squat
2. Bottom to top of the front squat, elbow transition press position, press to overhead
3. Overhead back to front squat rack position.

DEADLIFT

DEADLIFT TEACHING POINTS

There are three primary teaching points:
1. Set-Up
2. Lift
3. Reset

1. Set-Up—This is where to start/finish
The sumo deadlift is taught unloaded or with a kettlebell to Preschool and Kids as it is a much more natural
movement for them to adapt and use. Teens use both the sumo and standard stance deadlift with barbells.
Adult Cue
Lumbar curve, weight in heels, shoulder over the bar, bar in contact with shins, arms straight, head neutral.
Preschool and Kids Cue
Stand over and line your ankles up with the object. With your knees straight, bend over and grab the object.
Get an angry gorilla back.
Teens Cue
Hide the knot in your shoelaces with the bar. With your knees straight bend over and grab the object. With-
out moving the barbell push your knees forward until you touch the bar with your shins. Get an angry gorilla
back. (If lifting an object other than a barbell, then use the same cues as the Kids).

2. Lift—This is where to go

Adult Cue
Drive through the heels and extend legs while hips and shoulders rise at the same rate, once bar passes
knees, hips extend.

Preschool and Kids Cue
Keeping an angry gorilla back, stand up with the object.

Teens Cue
Staying weighted through the heels, drag the bar up your shins.

3. Reset

Adult Cue
Hips push back as shoulders move forward slightly, delaying the bending of the knees. Once the bar crosses
the knee, the torso angle is set and the knees flex back into the start position.

Preschool and Kids Cue
With an angry gorilla back set the object down.

Teens Cue
Keeping the bar against your legs, push your hips back and lower the bar to your knees. When there, bend
your knees and return the bar to the ground.

PULL-UP, PUSH-UP, AND HANDSTAND PUSH-UP

Listed below are the CrossFit Kids pull-up, push-up, and handstand push-up progressions: simple, safe, and effective
steps for teaching and coaching these movements.

Safety is paramount; always place appropriate matting below your children and ensure they are use a bar that allows
them to get on and off without assistance.

When teaching, strive to keep the verbiage and progression within the skill set that is appropriate for their physical,
social, emotional and cognitive maturity. Be patient: these progressions can and should take years of work for your
kids to complete.

THE PULL-UP

The pull-up is foundational and a backbone for solid CrossFit Kids’ programming. Though the movement is exactly
the same as that used by adults (dead hang, kipping, etc.), we use a different progression with kids to instill the proper
shoulder controlled kip (versus leg swinging/initiated).

All of the pull-up progression pieces below can be incorporated into any part of a class for each of the age groups;
imagination and ingenuity make this fun regardless of when and where it is placed! In every step, ensure the bar is
at an appropriate height (when hanging the child's feet should be no more than three to six inches off of the ground,
allowing them to get on the bar without assistance as well as fall with minimal chance for injury).

PROGRESSION

1. Bar Games
First, have kids move in as many different ways hanging from a pull-up bar with the goal to develop their grip
strength, as well as the awareness and strength of an active shoulder. The limit of this drill is up to the coach's
imagination, some examples are: knees to elbows, toes to bar, shuffle side to side, 180 degree turns, 360 degree
turns, one handed leg slap, high-five a partner, etc. In Bar Games, there is no competition. It is just fun movement
that teaches children how to safely and effectively hang from a pull-up bar. There is minimal technique needed;
the simplest of coaching and cueing are used.

Bar Games are appropriate for all ages.

2. Bar Wars
When appropriate, start adding competition to Bar Games with Bar Wars. Any movement used with Bar Games
can easily become a competition for all of your child athletes. For example: maximum bar hang using two hands,
maximum bar hang with one hand, 360 degree turn every time the whistle blows until the last athlete is hanging,
etc. This can be used any time during your Kids class as you see fit. It has been used with success as a finisher to
Bar Games when it is appropriate for the emotional maturity of the class (winning and loosing with dignity is a
learned and mature skill).

MOVEMENTS CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

3. Self-Assisted Deadhang Pull-up
Use a pull-up bar that is just below the child's chin when standing tall (if you do not have parallel bars or an
adjustable child’s pull up bar, put a barbell into a squat rack and use bands to lash the bar to the j-cups). Have
the child grasp the bar just outside of his/her shoulders (with thumbs around the bar!) and kneel down with their
toes curled beneath their feet and directly below the bar. From here, the child can assist their pull-up by pressing
through their toes and standing up. The child uses their legs to assist their upper body strength as much or as
little as needed (or if the more advanced kids already have dead hang pull-ups have them pick up their feet).

To increase the upper-body demand, adjust the feet so that the laces are laces down, making it more difficult to
use the legs and toes to stand. Both variations can be used with success because it is self-scaling. This means the
children are completing the same movement at their appropriate capacity without having to feel singled-out for
using a different bar height/set-up.

4. Superman/Hollow Drill
This drill is teaches kids how to move their bodies while lying on the ground. This is easier than performing
the same hanging from a bar. Have the children lay on their stomach, forehead on the ground, arms extended
“overhead” with hands shoulder width apart, legs and feet together with toes pointing away from their head. On
the “up” command, have them arch up (extend the spine) like Superman flying. The belly is on the ground, with
the chest arched off the ground with arms up and extended and legs long with feet together and toes off of the
ground. Teach the kids to remember this position and feeling: it is the “forward” position of the kip swing. Next,
have them roll them to their backs, arms still overhead and shoulder width apart, and legs long with feet together
and toes pointed away from their head. On the “up” command, have them use their abs to pull their body into
a “hollow” position. In the hollow, the low back pushes into the ground, trunk flexes with long arms that match
the torso angle, legs squeezed together with toes pointed away from their head, and heels six inches off of the
ground. Again, teach the kids to remember this position and feeling: it is the “back” position of the kip swing.

5. Self-Assisted Kipping Swing
The self-assisted kipping swing uses the same bar height and set-up that was used for the toes curled under
self-assisted dead hang pull-up. At the command of “Superman,” the children, pull their body with their hands and
push their body with their toes, into the same chest forward Superman position learned on the ground. At the
command of “Hollow,” have the children push through their trunk and arms and pull with their toes back through
to the hollow position learned on the ground. This “Superman/Hollow” becomes the vernacular and action for the
“forward/back" of the kip swing. When they are able to attain the proper positions, change to a “Superman-Hol-
low-Pull,” which adds a pull after the Hollow position to get their chin over the bar. This teaches the children how
the movement of the kip swing is to feel without the concurrent demand of supporting their bodyweight.

6. Kipping Pull-up
CrossFit Kids recommends a child has the ability to complete at least one deadhang pull-up before working on
kipping pull-ups. The shoulder and grip strength required of a deadhang pull-up better protects the athlete from
potential shoulder injury, as well as loss of their grip when attempting a kipping pull-up.

MOVEMENTS CrossFit Kids Training Guide | CrossFit

Movements, continued

With the capacity of one deadhang pull-up and the proficiency of the previous progression steps, it is time to
attempt kipping pull-ups. Trainers must ensure: the bar is the appropriate height, 2) there is matting beneath the
working children, and 3) children wrap their thumbs on the bar. While hanging from a bar with a slightly wider
than shoulder width grip, have the kids initiate the kip swing with a Superman/hollow and pull immediately after
the hollow position...and your kids will have their first kipping pull-up!

THE PUSH-UP

Due to its importance and potential difficulty (especially for children!), CrossFit has created the below progression
that successfully trains children in a manner that is both age and skill level appropriate. Like the pull-up progression,
all of the push-up progressions are appropriate during any part of class for all of the age groups.

PROGRESSION

1. Plank Position
For the plank position, the child assumes the “top” of the push-up position. The body is in a hollow position,
with the arms extended and toes facing the ground. Holding this position helps develop strength and body
awareness there.

2. Plank Games
Like with Bar Games for pull-ups, the different plank positions for this are limited by the imagination of the coach.
Some examples are: plank on hands, plank on elbows, right hand to the sky, left hand to the sky, barrel roll, 360
degree turn, plank shuffle, etc. The more movement of the plank position the more fun for kids; change is key!

3. Plank Wars
When appropriate, like with the pull-up Bar Wars, it is beneficial to add competition to the plank position with
Plank Wars. In Plank Wars, two athletes face each other in the plank position about a foot apart. Children can then
either clasp opposite hands together or touch opposite hands in an open palm grip. On the command of “Go!”
each athlete tries to pull (clasped hands) or push (open hands) the other athlete out of the plank position. The
winner is the athlete who remains in the plank position.

4. Snake-up
In the snake-up, the children start in a plank position and then lower their body to the ground—keeping the body
as Straight as possible. Then, the kids get back to the plank position in any manner possible (while a straight plank
position is preferred for both up and down, this takes time!). This is a self-scaling movement that allows all chil-
dren to participate regardless of ability.

We have found that knee push-ups, though a completely legitimate scale, are more limited in their transferability
to plank push-ups. Knee push-ups are also faster than plank push-ups, making it potentially undesirable to learn
how to perform a plank push-up as their total number performed decreases compared to their knee push-up
score (no fun for a child). Finally, children do not do enough push-ups, in terms of total repetitions or speed of
movement, to be a legitimate concern to the health of their low spine. High reps and dynamic movement are a
Teen skill and ability; they are not fun for Preschool and Kids aged athletes. As an extra precaution, ensure you
program low reps for younger children working on the push-up to them safe.

5. Push-up
As the child matures, they will be able to keep a more rigid plank position through the full push-up range of
motion. By being patient with their development using the aforementioned progression steps, your children will
be successful in the movement from the first try!

THE HANDSTAND PUSH-UP

Anytime an athlete is on their hands upside down there is risk for potential injury, and a coaching progression and
protective gymnastic mats are required to maximize safety. Below is a progression adopted from a coach of the USA
Women’s Olympic Gymnastic team. This progression is appropriate for children of all ability levels to achieve a hand-
stand push-up, while also minimizing the need for physical spotting of the child by the coach.

PROGRESSION

1. Forward Roll
Before ever trying a handstand, you must first teach them how to safely and effectively bail out of the position.
This is taught with a forward roll. Have the athlete kneel down, place their hands slightly wider than shoulder
width apart in front of them, and place the top of their head in the middle of their hands and slightly farther from
their knees (creating a triangle between their hands and head). Then have the athlete, pushing hard into the
ground with their hands, extend their knees and walk their feet toward their face. As they near their face with their
toes cue them to look at their belly button and the athlete will roll through ending up in the seated position. Once
they have mastered this, increase the difficulty of the roll. Some ideas include: standing forward roll, jumping for-
ward roll, backwards roll, log roll, cart wheel, etc. This is both fantastic for developing a robust vestibular system
as well as very effective at teaching a safety skill for any and all activities, be it recovering from a handstand or a
bicycle crash. Some type of roll should be incorporated in every single kids class.

2. Stink Bug

The goal is to incrementally place more and more of the athlete's center of mass over their shoulder. This begins
with the stink bug on the ground, which is simply a piked-plank position (hips high and feet closer to the hands).
Have the athletes lower their head to the ground slightly in front of and in-between their hands (the same hand
and head triangle position used for the start of the forward roll) and then press back to the start position. Prox-
imity of the feet to the hands is dependent on the athlete's ability: the closer the feet to the hands the more chal-
lenging the movement. We recommend to start farther away than the athletes want (at first) and slowly move
the toes closer to the feet after each successful repetition. This is another self-scaling movement as each athlete
can change the difficult to meet their needs. This stink bug position forces the athlete into a hollow trunk when
they are pressing, nullifying the problems of overextension of the spine often seen with a full range of motion
handstand push-up.

Once ready, we continue to raise the hips by putting the knees, and then the toes, up on a box. Similarly, moving
the hands closer to the box increases the difficulty. This drill allows many different levels to be challenged with
a single box height. Ensure the box is flush against a wall (so it cannot tip), place a gymnastics mat down on the
hands’ side of the box, and always have the children put their hands on the ground before putting their knees/
toes up on the box. Also ensure that the knees/toes are as close to the edge of the mat side of the box as possible,
then adjusting the hands distance from the box for a successful, but challenging, repetition completion. Stink
bugs, be it from the ground or a box, are very difficult and require little to no gear; these should be used as a
staple to increase overhead strength and body awareness for inverted capacity.

3. Box Kick-up

This is to teach an athlete the body position for kicking up to a handstand. With a box set up against a wall and
a gymnastics mat on the other side of the box (like used for the stink bug, above), have the athlete stand on the
mat and face the wall, placing hands on the closest two box corners. Then, the athlete moves their feet back until
they form a straight, horizontal body from hip through the hands. The point is to have an ideal overhead position
in a horizontal plane. Have the athlete push into the box with an active shoulder, and keeping the body long, kick
up a couple of inches with one foot and then the other. As the athlete kicks up, ensure there is no change in the
spine; this teaches the athlete how to kick up without breaking about the midline. Once able, add in a toe tap. At
the apex of the kick, tap the opposite foot to the kicking foot. With proficiency, continue to lower the box and raise
the kick/toe tap until the athlete is able to kick up to near vertical under control and tap their toes together with
their hands on the ground.

4. Wall Walk

The wall walk can be done in tandem with the box kick-up. A wall walk begins with the athlete in the bottom of
the push-up and both heels touching the wall on top of a gymnastics mat. The athlete initiates the movement
with a push-up, and then walks their feet up the wall as they walk their hands towards the wall. Throughout the
movement, the athlete must maintain control and rigid throughout their body (especially their midline!). Initially,
the top of the wall walk is as far as vertical as they can get while still being able to get back to the starting position
under their own control. Eventually, the movement's full expression is a vertical handstand with only the chest
and toes touching the wall.

You can also play wall walk games, which is adding different movements while in the top of the wall walk position,
i.e.: right hand up, left hand tap your head, shuffle left, touch your leg, etc. To bail, either walk back down the wall
the opposite way they went up, complete a forward roll or perform a handstand pirouette.

5. Handstand Kick-ups
With proficiency in both the box kick-up and full range of motion wall walk, it is time to kick up to the wall. With
a gymnastics mat against the wall and athlete facing the wall in a standing position and hands overhead use,
the same kick-up technique learned in the box kick-up. This should bring the athlete to a handstand position
with only the heels touching the wall. Games can be used as when the athletes are facing the wall, i.e. head taps,
shuffle, etc. Demand a hollow body, toes pointed, extended elbows and 180 degrees between the torso and arm.

6. Handstand Push-up
With all of the handstand and pressing fundamentals completed, it is time to work lowering the athlete’s head to
the triangle position slightly in front of and between their hands (reference the triangle position used in the for-
ward roll and stink bug) and pressing back out, ending in a proper handstand position. Be ready to be amazed by
your child athletes. Time and focus on this progression will create strong, able athletes in the handstand position!

KID SAFETY

ENVIRONMENTAL AND BOX SAFETY

Start of each class: ask how they are doing and eyeball the class.

Teach “Freeze” as soon as possible.

Advise hydration often, appropriate clothing, jewelry, athletic shoes.

Use padding where needed, such as on poles and under rings.

Use a suspended jump rope for max height jumps to avoid fall hazards from tall boxes.

Sanitize and disinfect bars, weights, pull-up structures often.

Use of anti-viral, staph, MRSA, bacterial lesion spray (IV 7 Ultimate Germ Defense) as soon as injury
detected.

EQUIPMENT

Keep C2 rower display in upright position to avoid handle crashes into display.

Warning to avoid putting fingers under rower seat, as well as loose or tied clothing that my be caught
beneath the seat.

Use wooden or plastic rings, no metal or ceramic.

Do not pick up weights until told to do so; clanging dumbbells together degrades welds.

Stagger lines when using PVC, hold vertically until told to move.

Use cones to divide training space and outside to provide traffic barriers where needed.

Teach Teens how to ditch bars.

Teach Kids to swing the kettlebell to eye level only.

STAFFING

Trainer at front and back of group when running outdoors.
Trainers Child CPR trained

HEALTH ISSUES/MEDICAL INFORMATION

Upgrade CPR and Defibrillator certifications to include children.
Create and maintain Emergency Card info on site.
Be aware: Parents don't like labels for their children and getting information may be difficult.
HIPPA/PAR-Q can of worms: liability issues are everywhere. We recommend the following:
o “What do I/we need to know so that I/we may provide the best care for your child?”
© Instigate parental communication regarding changes in child’s health status.
Find out if you need a release to administer medications in your state/province/country.
Common meds for kids, asthma inhalers, ADHD medication.
Antibiotic awareness; some antibiotics have side effects specific to what we do.

SPECIAL POPULATIONS
* Give atrial period to see if it works and evaluate benefit for child vs. class disruption.
* CrossFit Kids has had success with integrating ADHD and children with autism, cerebral palsy, brain
injuries and developmental disabilities).
* Parents MUST stay during class.
* Staffing may need to be increased to accommodate well.

RHABDO AND KIDS
* From your CF Level 1 Course: “What are the primary symptoms of rhabdo?”
*  Itcan occur in Kids and/or Teens.
* Very rare in kids; the theory is that they naturally stop but can be “pushed.”
* Read Dr. Mike Ray's article on rhabdo from the CrossFit Journal and Level 1 Training Guide.
* Rhabdo: Myoglobin leaking into the bloodstream potentially reducing or stopping kidney function.
* Kids and Teens do not have the same exposure/symptom profile.
* Common causes of exercise-induced rhabdo:
° High-rep eccentric movements-such as jumping pull-ups, partner pull-ups, jumping squats,
kettlebell swings, GHD sit-ups, downhill running.
* Additional factors contributing to increased risk:
o Alcohol or drug abuse, use of statins, periods of long-bone growth (adolescence), recent flu, use of
Tylenol.
* Common symptoms in adults:
o Extreme muscle soreness and weakness, swelling/inflammation and dark colored urine (cola color).
* Teens may not present all three symptoms and still have rhabdo (they often show only one or two of the
symptoms).
© Teens are more likely to get rhabdo than Kids because:
* They will push themselves harder for the time/weight, just like adults.
* In teen growth spurts, long bones grow and muscles are stretched taut before having a chance to
lengthen and accommodate bone growth; thus, muscles are predisposed to muscular degradation and
break down before any activity.

* What are the age groups for CrossFit Kids/Teens classes?
© Generally speaking: Preschool/Pre-K—3-5 years, Kids—5-12, Preteens—10-12, and Teens—12-18.
However, rather than relying solely on age, we encourage you to let a client's mental, emotional and
physical maturity dictate the appropriate class.

* When should I promote a CrossFit Kids athlete to CrossFit Teens class?
© Promotion of children through the different classes should be case by case, but generally speaking
promotion should occur when the child begins to demonstrate the mental, emotional and physical
traits associated with the next class. It is also important to consider when the client wants to make
that jump.

CROSSFIT KIDS CERTIFICATE COURSE
* Can we offer kids CrossFit classes without attending the course?
o Yes, you are welcome to train children at your affiliate.

+ Where dol find a list of upcoming online CrossFit Kids Courses?
o Upcoming courses can be found on the CrossFit Kids page on CrossFit.com.

BUSINESS PLANNING/PUBLIC RELATIONS
1, Pursue excellence.
2. Find out about your community and look at your demographics (stay-at-home moms versus commuters,
homeschool market, etc.) to determine optimal time slots.
3. You are not in competition with the time slots of other programs and activities; rather you are optimizing
time to ensure a lifelong love of fitness.
CrossFit Kids does not provide daycare; we are optimizing a lifelong love of fitness.
No elements classes for kids; matriculate new athletes directly into classes.
Investigate special promotions at your gym (i.e., bring-a-friend day, earn a T-shirt, etc.).
Talk with local coaches.
Show up to your local sports practices on cut day.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STARTING A CROSSFIT KIDS CLASS
1. Start with the one age group that you are most comfortable with (Preschool, Kids, or Teens).
2. Pick the right trainer for the right age group.
3. Start small, preferably 2-3 kids from current adult members or staff; work with these kids for 4-5 weeks
before adding others.
4. Set your box up to be kid friendly.
Use the suggested format and time frame as a start point for each different age group.
6. Teach the movements in the order taught during the small-group breakout (squats, presses, and deadlifts
first; front squats, thrusters, and sumo deadlift high pulls second; etc.).
7. For Preschool and Kids teach safety immediately, such as “freeze,” “line up,” etc.
8. Build aclass culture from the start; i.e., set behavior and contact expectations and stick to them.
9. Set parental expectations (logistics, clothing, water, medication, drop-off and pickup, payment, etc.).
10. Add kids only when you feel comfortable both with your ability to teach and your space/gear allows.
11. Re-evaluate constantly; are they having fun and being challenged?

wi

SUGGESTED PRICING STRATEGIES
1. Price your CrossFit Kids fees in the range of local dance schools, gymnastics classes, martial arts, etc.
2. The first child per family roughly half the price of an adult member, siblings half of the first-child price.
3. Family plan discount.
4. Free week trial sessions for children.

SAMPLE CROSSFIT KIDS PARENT LETTER

09 March, 20XX
Dear CrossFit Kids’ Parent,

Thank you for allowing your child to be a part of the CrossFit Kids Class! The commitment to our children’s future

is a beautiful, arduous, amazingly nuanced path; the coaches are excited you have chosen CrossFit Kids to be a
part of that path as CrossFit has changed all of our lives immeasurably for the better. With your child, we are not
only able to potentially enhance their lives, but we also have the opportunity to shape their lives and their realities
within them. It is with this endeavor | have dedicated my life; your child’s safety and opportunity to potentiate their
personal lives are my primary focus.

| wanted to take this opportunity, now that the Kids Class is underway, to introduce myself formally and to set some
policies and procedures for the safety of your child and the efficacy of their CrossFit class experience.

My name is...
| started training ...

We will be running three major groups for classes: Preschool (ages 3-5), Kids (ages 5-12), Teens (ages 12-18). Please
note that it is not the age of your child that is the deciding factor for what class he or she attends. It is largely based
upon individual skill, athleticism, and maturity and is ultimately decided upon by the head coach to ensure your
child is getting the most out of the CrossFit experience. Preschool class lasts 20 minutes, Kids class lasts 30 minutes,
and the Teens class is broken into a one-hour weightlifting session (by invitation only based on their movement
mechanics and desire) and 50-minute classes that look much like an adult class.

As previously stated, your child’s safety is paramount to the coaches, and it is with this focus | need your help. Below
are some rules that we must enforce as a CrossFit Community to best protect your child; please:

1. Walk your children inside the building for the start of the class, and come inside the building to pick them up.

2. Bring your children to the designated Kid area, where the head coach will meet them and take them onto the
gym floor for the day’s class.

3. Immediately notify the head coach if you see anyone in the parking lot or in the gym who does not belong
there.

4. Unless pre-arranged with the head coach, the children are only allowed to go home with the person who
drops them off.

5. Until | get to know all of you and your children by name, please sign your child in and out with the head coach
so | can ensure they are going home with the appropriate person.

6. Payment is month to month, and due the first of each month.

7. Awaiver, signed by a parent or legal guardian, is required for each child before he or she is allowed to
participate in a class.

8. Ensure your child has a bottle of water, or a bottle that can be filled up at the drinking fountain. Don’t forget
to put your child’s name on it!

9. Ensure your children are wearing clothes appropriate for running, jumping, rolling, pulling, swinging,
climbing, crawling, throwing, and being upside down.

10. If you choose to stay and watch the class (which | hope you do!), please do not coach your child.

11. Children with disciplinary problems: first warning-free of consequence, second warning-sit out the first two
minutes of the game, third warning-go to the parent.

12. Finally, please make the head coach aware of any special needs for your children that may facilitate their
individual safety, learning, and growth (i.e., medications, illness, physical/mental limitations, injury, sports,
etc.).

| look forward to getting to know all of you personally and training your children to the utmost of my ability. If you
have any questions, comments, problems, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to get a hold of me at the following:

Signed,
