# F4 (leaderboard + TV) + F5 (read-only gym view) — wodwisdom build

> **⚠️ PARKED for Engine Class v1 (Decision 9(i), 2026-07-04).** Engine Class became PURE
> DISTRIBUTION of the retail Engine (a seat grants the retail `engine` feature; the member
> gets the retail Engine surfaces, not a gym-shared workout/leaderboard). Everything below —

_2026-07-03. The wodwisdom half of GYM_PORTAL_FLOWS §F4/§F5, built on the merged
cohort program (#551) + the F2/F3 roster. Companion to the affiliate
`docs/F4_MODERATION_CONTRACT.md` (the two cross-repo seams)._

## The gate (F5, decided in the #550 review)

`gate.ts` — TWO tiers (Decision 8), both requiring `member_gym_links.status='joined'`
AND an active gym-granted entitlement `granted_by` that gym (**never the link alone** —
ex-members / cancelled gyms would otherwise see programming forever, since the
link-ending writer is a cross-repo follow-up):

- **VIEW access** (F5 read-only workout): the paid seat `engine_cohort` **OR** the free
  `engine_class_view` grant issued at F3 join. `resolveMemberGymAccess` returns the
  held features; `engine-class-view` renders the workout for either tier and sets
  `can_log`/`tier` from whether a seat is held.
- **SEAT access** (`engine-class-log`, `engine-class-leaderboard`): `engine_cohort`
  ONLY (`resolveSeatGym`). A free-tier member gets the read-only workout + a
  "activate your seat to log + join the leaderboard" prompt; the log/leaderboard 403.
- The cohort roster (`gym-cohort-cron`) and TV are `engine_cohort`-only, unchanged.

A member with NEITHER grant sees a leak-safe teaser (no programming) — the "ask the
front desk" state. The feature lists live in `_shared/entitlements.ts`
(`ALLOWED_GRANT_FEATURES` / `ENGINE_CLASS_VIEW_FEATURES` / `ENGINE_CLASS_SEAT_FEATURES`),
shared with `wholesale-grants` so issuing and gating can't drift.

> **Decision 8 (RESOLVED, founder 2026-07-04).** The free-tier population is created by
> a free `engine_class_view` grant issued at F3 join (affiliate enroll path), revoked
> with the gym's other grants and never billed. The decided gate rule is unchanged —
> content still requires an active gym grant. This PR implements the wodwisdom half:
> `engine_class_view` in the grants allowlist + the VIEW gate; seat surfaces stay
> `engine_cohort`. The affiliate half (grant at join / revoke on removal) is the enroll
> path's to add.

## "Today's workout" mapping (gap: cohort programs have no calendar anchor)

`selectTodaysWorkout` (pure): flatten the cohort `WriterOutput` weeks→days into an
ordered workout list; `dayOfCycle = whole days since the program's created_at`; pick
`min(dayOfCycle, lastIndex)` — one workout per calendar day, HOLDING on the last until
the monthly cron regenerates. Gives the whole gym ONE shared "today's workout" so the
per-workout leaderboard is well-defined. **v1 limitation:** a real per-gym class
schedule (which weekdays the class runs) is a follow-up; today it advances daily.

## Leaderboard (F4)

- **Divisions:** gender (from `athlete_profiles`, read-time) + the workout's modality.
  Per-workout board: modality is constant → gender divisions. Season: gender only
  (modality varies across the season), points = Σ over workouts of `(participants −
  rank + 1)`.
- **W·kg (default) + raw toggle.** W·kg = `avg_power_watts / live bodyweight` — watts
  computed once at LOG time via the data-service work-calc; the **per-kg divisor is the
  profile's current bodyweight at READ time** (ONE PROFILE corollary a — nothing caches
  bodyweight as a second write target). Physics failure-soft: null watts → the entry
  ranks on raw score only.
- **Privacy:** output is rank + display name + metric + division only — never email /
  user_id / raw rows. Opted-out (`profiles.leaderboard_anonymous`) → "Anonymous
  Athlete"; admins + `leaderboard_excluded` never appear (mirrors the retail RPCs).

## Moderation seams (F4_MODERATION_CONTRACT)

- **Seam 1 (exposed): `engine-class-entries`.** The affiliate reads a gym's entries to
  moderate. `POST { gym_id, class_id? }` + `X-Service-Key` → `{ entries: [{ result_ref,
  wodwisdom_user_id, member_name, workout_label, raw_score, wkg_score, division }] }`.
  wodwisdom keys on `gym_id` (its cohort program's tenant); `class_id` is echoed (the
  affiliate's ledger key; one Engine Class per gym at v1). `result_ref` =
  `engine_class_results.id`. Moderation is NOT anonymized (gym staff own integrity).
- **Seam 2 (consumed): `moderation-client.fetchModerations`.** The leaderboard + TV
  ENFORCE the affiliate ledger — drop `hide`, badge `flag`, substitute `adjust` — applied
  BEFORE ranking. The affiliate exposes this as the `get_active` action on its
  multi-action `engine-moderation` endpoint, so the request MUST carry the action:
  `POST AFFILIATE_MODERATION_URL { action: "get_active", gym_id, class_id? }` +
  `X-Service-Key AFFILIATE_MODERATION_KEY` → `{ moderations: [{ result_ref, decision,
  adjustment|null }] }`. **Graceful degrade:** unconfigured/unreachable → render
  unmoderated (never fatal), mirroring the affiliate's own ledger-only fallback.

> **Coordinate with the affiliate team (their next-action 5):** seam-2's affiliate read
> endpoint isn't built yet — this build is the real caller, so the shape above is the
> one to implement (contract seam 2, option B). Once it exists + `AFFILIATE_MODERATION_URL`
> is set, the board goes from unmoderated to enforcing the ledger with no wodwisdom change.
> Also give the affiliate `WODWISDOM_LEADERBOARD_URL` = the `engine-class-entries` URL +
> `WODWISDOM_LEADERBOARD_KEY` so seam 1 lights up.

## TV mode

`gym_tv_tokens(gym_id, token, revoked_at)` — a high-entropy token is the capability.
`/tv/:token` (public route, no login) polls `engine-class-tv` every 30s: today's Rx +
the rolling W·kg board (moderation applied). Mint a token per gym (SQL insert / a future
admin/portal action); revoke by setting `revoked_at`.

## Deploy (founder — batched)

- Apply migration `20260705000000_engine_class_leaderboard.sql` (SQL editor) + reload
  PostgREST. Adds `engine_class_results` + `gym_tv_tokens`.
- Deploy edge fns: `engine-class-view`, `engine-class-log`, `engine-class-leaderboard`,
  `engine-class-entries`, `engine-class-tv`.
- **Secrets:**
  - `WODWISDOM_LEADERBOARD_KEY` (≥16 chars) on `engine-class-entries` — the s2s key the
    affiliate presents for seam 1. Share the value + the function URL with the affiliate.
  - `AFFILIATE_MODERATION_URL` + `AFFILIATE_MODERATION_KEY` on `engine-class-leaderboard`
    + `engine-class-tv` — seam 2 (set once the affiliate exposes its read endpoint;
    until then the board degrades to unmoderated, no error).
  - `COMPETITION_SERVICE_BASE_URL` + `WORK_CALC_SERVICE_KEY` on `engine-class-log` — the
    physics API for W·kg (already used elsewhere; reuse the same values).
- Mint a `gym_tv_tokens` row per pilot gym for the wall URL.

## Checks

`deno check` clean on all 5 edge fns + shared modules; **9 unit tests** pass
(`engine-class_test.ts`: workout selection incl. cycle-hold + empty; W·kg read-time
bodyweight; divisions; moderation hide/flag/adjust-rerank; season points; score parse).
`tsc -b` + `vite build` + `eslint` clean on all new frontend files. Migration
syntax-reviewed (no local Postgres in session to live-apply — verify at deploy).
